         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170036:6"/> as the <hi>Priſoners</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Prizes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi> what then will become of all thoſe <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians that make Covenants in Conſcience, and break Covenants out of neceſſity? That like children ſtand on the earth with their heads, and boldly ſhake their heels towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? That ſet up the Kingdom of Chriſt no faſter than they can rear their own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms? of all thoſe that had rather themſelves ſhould reign in a corner, than that our Lord and Master ſhould rule in the whole World? Never thinking, how thoſe Crowns that now ſit light on their Heads, will ere long lye heavy on their Conſciences.

And as for this Nation in ſpecial, my prayers to the Lord are, that <hi>Holineſs</hi> may not onely have a <hi>tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> but an <hi>Authority</hi> amongſt us, againſt <hi>Licenciouſneſs</hi> both of
<hi>Judgement</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> that the <hi>Rulers</hi> of <hi>England</hi> may not ſay, <hi>The time is not come that the Lords houſe ſhould be built, but rather hear God ſay, is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ſciled houſes, and this houſe lie waſte? Hag.</hi> 1. That they would expeditiouſly do the work of this age. Becauſe, <hi>to every purpoſe there is a time and judgement, therefore the miſery of man is great upon him,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. <hi>That our Officers may not onely be Peace, but that our Exactors Righteouſneſs, that we may be made an eternal excellency, and the joy of many Generations,</hi> Iſa. 60. That ſaying in your hearts, <hi>the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be our ſtrength in the Lord of Hoſts; they may be like an Hearth of fire among the wood, and like a Torch of fire in a ſheaf, devouring</hi> Sions <hi>enemies round about on the right hand, and on the left.</hi> Zech. 12.</p>
                  <p>For ſhame therefore let <hi>Virgins</hi> ariſe, and either get <hi>oyle,</hi> or caſt away their <hi>Lamps.</hi> Security makes you uncapable both of

                     <hi>ſeeing</hi> your <hi>reward,</hi> or <hi>doing</hi> your <hi>work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Think not becauſe you can properly be but once <hi>regenerated,</hi> that you need but once to <hi>repent. Converted David (q d.)</hi> muſt <hi>repent</hi> of his <hi>Adultery</hi> before he be <hi>ſaved; Repentance</hi> is not onely as <hi>life</hi> to the dead, but as
<hi>ſalve</hi> to the <hi>wounded ſinner; Repentance</hi> is as the <hi>Vowels in the Alphabet,</hi> which we have not onely need of to ſpell with while we are <hi>Babes,</hi> but to read with all when we are men in Chriſt, <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> are not
<hi>accidents</hi> or things by the by, but of the very ſubſtance, the very <hi>Materials and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem. The Goſpell it ſelf, I ſuſpect will, ere long, be but an old Almanack to them, to whom Repentance and confeſſing of, and mourning over ſin is now</hi> (upon what glorious pretences ſoever) <hi>out of date.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Plead for <hi>Opinions</hi> as <hi>Opinions,</hi> and for <hi>Graces</hi> as for
<hi>Graces.</hi> I fear thoſe that plead for <hi>diſputable Opinions,</hi> as <hi>infallible Truths,</hi> will ere long hold <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Truths,</hi> as conformity to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſincere <hi>Faith</hi> in, and <hi>repentance</hi> towards Chriſt, but as <hi>failable</hi> and <hi>fallible Opinions;</hi> This is intollerable folly, to ſee men
<hi>ſlaves</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:170036:7"/> 
                     <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> over Graces, <hi>if the Lord extinguiſh not this fond zeal, the carnal world hence forward will take advantage to think that Religion lies onely in thinking and conceiving, and in the next age conclude they are not to ſeek Religion in their Bibles, but in the brains of men.</hi> O Lord! How many are <hi>true</hi> to <hi>falſe Principles,</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> to <hi>true Principles;</hi> and will rather die
<hi>Martyrs</hi> for <hi>Error,</hi> than bow as <hi>Servants</hi> to <hi>Truth.</hi> Theſe are ſome of them that have been <hi>over wiſe</hi> (in their own eyes) and yet as the
<hi>wiſeman</hi> ſpeaks have <hi>not known the way to the City,</hi> that <hi>call this or that way, Chriſt, and not Chriſt, the way;</hi> that ſet up an <hi>Image</hi> in their own
<hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and cenſure all the world as <hi>Idolaters</hi> that will not do
<hi>homage</hi> to it, <hi>proclaiming ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> with <hi>Lutes</hi> and <hi>Cymbals</hi> of peace, and though on the firſt <hi>entertainment</hi> of ſuch <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> men have had a <hi>calmneſs</hi> in their <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> yet afterwards have found themſelves burning in a <hi>Furnace</hi> of diſcontents and <hi>doubts,</hi> as then remembring that neither this or that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion <hi>availed any thing to peace in Chriſt, but a new creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, While you cry out againſt the <hi>old Superſtition,</hi> beware of being tainted with the
<pb facs="tcp:170036:8"/> 
                     <hi>new diſeaſe</hi> of this age, not the <hi>plague of the guts,</hi> but of the
<hi>heart;</hi> not the <hi>Rickets in the head,</hi> but the <hi>pride of life,</hi> alias
<hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>apparent Prophaneneſs.</hi> Fly as far from
<hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs</hi> as you do from the <hi>formality of Rome.</hi> Woe be to the
<hi>profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> if your <hi>Profeſſion</hi> ſhould ſtand or fall to the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> of the world. Oh! let not thoſe whom you muſt one day
<hi>judge,</hi> juſtly <hi>judge</hi> you now. Some poſſibly may ſay, <hi>The world are dogs, and their mouths muſt be ſtopped;</hi> Chriſt is a <hi>myſtery,</hi> our
<hi>principles</hi> are above their <hi>cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,</hi> they are not competent <hi>Judges</hi> of our <hi>converſations.</hi> I anſwer, We muſt then endeavor to ſilence them as much in our
<hi>lives,</hi> as they condemn us with their <hi>lips;</hi> otherwiſe <hi>pretence</hi> of aſſurance and <hi>participation</hi> of the Divine creature will make them <hi>abhor</hi> profeſſion as a meer <hi>deſign,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Lo, there is ſo much difference between that Religion that is in our Bibles, and that which is in your Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we profeſs either you are not Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, or this is not Goſpel.</hi> Take heed of
<hi>putting</hi> out the eyes of Conſcience, and then to make <hi>apology</hi> for your
<hi>blindneſs; Conſcience is Gods Vice-gerent, but it is not our Law-giver; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is out guide, but the Word is our way,
<pb facs="tcp:170036:8"/> and there is no excuſe in following our Guide out of our way,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Call not that poyſon which is your Milk, and <hi>ſtrike</hi> not thoſe Breaſts which once you <hi>ſtroaked;</hi> ſay not the preaching down of ſin is the preaching up of the Law. <hi>Trample</hi> not thoſe <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> under your <hi>feet,</hi> who have rejoyced to carry your ſouls in their arms to Chriſt; have not low thoughts of them, that have low thoughts of themſelves and high thoughts of Chriſt; that care not though they be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing (who yet are ſomething in your eyes) that Chriſt, who is little eſteemed in the world, may be <hi>All in All.</hi> But if the Bridemen be deſpiſed, oh that the Bridegroom might the more be honored: <hi>Oh that that love which is denied to the Servants, might abundantly be given to their Maſter.</hi> I confeſs it were better for ſome to have an hundred a year to be ſilent, they ſo inſtead of preaching Chriſt crucified, crucifie Chriſt in preaching, they ſo wound and kill Religion in the Pulpit where they ſhould give it life. While you endeavor their <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall,</hi> forget not to pray for their <hi>converſion, Paul</hi> was a
<hi>Saul.</hi> Let not therefore your vertue be only in ſpeaking againſt the <hi>Vices</hi> of others. It is an eaſie matter to trample on thoſe that are on the ground already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170036:9"/>Fifthly, Take heed of the <hi>Corinthian diſeaſe,</hi> I am for <hi>Paul,</hi> no, I am for <hi>Apollo,</hi> no, I am for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if we might not love
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> too; In the primitive times, they (as in the <hi>Acts</hi>) kept together in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, <hi>and there was no controverſie at all amongſt them,</hi> one copy adds; but oh that thoſe now that have but one <hi>Head</hi> had but one <hi>heart.</hi> It is ſad to conſider, how that the nigher any come to an
<hi>agreement</hi> in matters of Religion, and yet <hi>differ</hi> in ſome things, that the greater ſhould be their <hi>difference;</hi> as there is a greater <hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and <hi>Papiſt,</hi> than between the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and the
<hi>Jew;</hi> was it not ſo in <hi>Germany,</hi> is it not ſo in <hi>England,</hi> between thoſe that are called <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians? Oh that we did conſider, that though</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Peter <hi>be in Heaven, yet that there are neither</hi> Paulians
<hi>nor</hi> Petrians <hi>in Heaven, that Chriſt is not a</hi> Calveniſt <hi>in the</hi> Calviniſts, <hi>or a</hi> Lutheran <hi>in the Lutherans, but in thoſe that are Chriſtians amongſt both, All in All.</hi> God muſt ſcourge this folly from us; his children are a wrangling, and we may expect that either he ſhould <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> or <hi>correct</hi> us. O Lord! if mans <hi>Apoſtate</hi> were thy <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> and mans <hi>Heretick</hi> thy
<pb facs="tcp:170036:9"/> 
                     <hi>Heretick,</hi> and mans <hi>Reprobate,</hi> always thy <hi>Reprobate, Election</hi> to <hi>Eternal life</hi> would prove but a <hi>Fable,</hi> and all the world would be
<hi>damned.</hi> We are ſo <hi>cenſorious</hi> of others, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and that but in things
<hi>diſputable,</hi> poſſibly, in many things <hi>indifferent,</hi> as if <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Hell</hi> did <hi>hang at our Girdles,</hi> as if thoſe were in a <hi>damnable</hi> eſtate whom our paſſions <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,</hi> and thoſe onely <hi>ſaved indeed,</hi> that have our (good) opinion or word. The <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt which he ſaid was <hi>eaſie,</hi> may it juſtly be made <hi>heavier</hi> by the Governors of the Church, nay, by private <hi>partial Chriſtians</hi> in after ages? The Apoſtles profeſs, <hi>They revealed to the Church the whole Counſel of God, keeping back nothing</hi> needful for our Salvation; what <hi>tyranny</hi> is it then to <hi>impoſe</hi> any new, certainly doubtful matters on the Faith of Chriſtians, (eſpecially as ſome <hi>Popelings</hi> daily do) under that <hi>Cananding</hi> form. <hi>He that beleeves not ſhall be damned.</hi> In the Apoſtles time, or a little after (as is judged)
<hi>There were twelve Articles of the Creed,</hi> but now we have more Creeds than they had Articles; ſo many men ſo many minds, nay, ſo many opinions (which yet are far from the life of Chriſt) ſo many Faiths, and though our Lord Jeſus ſaith, he
<pb facs="tcp:170036:10"/> that beleeves in him ſhall be ſaved, we now cannot be ſaved but by beleeving more, and as the world continues, ſo we increaſe in our <hi>Beleef,</hi> and upon this giddy accompt poor ignorant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted ſinners know not when they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve enough to ſalvation. But when our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> ſhall appear, he will not <hi>prefer</hi> one
<hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> and reject another, ſo much as prefer all the <hi>upright,</hi> and reject all the <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the <hi>Lord of Opinions</hi> but of <hi>Souls,</hi> not one
<hi>ſheep</hi> that hath his <hi>mark</hi> ſhall be <hi>left out</hi> of his <hi>Fold,</hi> nor one <hi>Child</hi> that bears his <hi>image</hi> ſhall either be kept or <hi>thruſt</hi> out of his <hi>Family;</hi> now, they are Faith and Love, Singleneſs and ſincerity of heart.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Remember that the <hi>Ordinances of Chriſt</hi> are not his <hi>Grave,</hi> wherein he lies, but the <hi>Throne</hi> whereon he ſits as <hi>King of his Church.</hi> That you ſhall never be <hi>above Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> untill you are above <hi>tentations;</hi> and that they loſe not their <hi>Authority,</hi> becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we miſs their <hi>Influence;</hi> and that they are <hi>appointed</hi> not onely to bring men into, but alſo to bring men up in Chriſt.
<hi>The Bible is not the Word of God, becauſe it is imprinted in the hearts of men, but becauſe it was written by the inſpiration and finger of God.</hi> Theſe are
<pb facs="tcp:170036:10"/> Breaſts though ſometimes we cannot ſuck, or milk out conſolation from them;
<hi>for otherwiſe, every time we have new affections, there ſhould be a new Goſpell, and in the end there ſhould be as many diſtinct Bibles, as there are new Experiences in the world.</hi> It is true, they are the <hi>Conduit-Pipes,</hi> and we have no comfort from them unleſs Chriſt <hi>convey</hi> his blood through them: Yet ſhall they be <hi>nothing</hi> (in reſpect of Gods <hi>Authority)</hi> becauſe they <hi>(quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad hic &amp; nunc)</hi> do nothing upon us? The <hi>Ordinances</hi> are <hi>dead creatures</hi> onely to thoſe that are
<hi>dead</hi> in their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and are not alive in Chriſt. The
<hi>Ordinances</hi> cannot work without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> (ordinarily) will not work without the <hi>Ordinances.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtians prefer not the
<hi>Letter</hi> before the <hi>Spirit,</hi> neither oppoſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> to the
<hi>Letter</hi> (as the manner of ſome is) leſt in the end you prove neither for the
<hi>Letter</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> As ever you would be comforted by, take heed of ſcoffing at the Spirit. Quench not the Spirit in your ſelves, grieve it not in others.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Let us take heed of <hi>Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> Let us not ſpend that time in examining the <hi>Lamps</hi> of others, while we neglect to get <hi>oyl</hi> into our own
<hi>Veſſels.</hi> Chriſtians, look about you! you live in an <hi>infectious Air,</hi> therefore
<pb facs="tcp:170036:11"/> take <hi>cordials;</hi> where ever he hath a <hi>poyſon,</hi> have you an
<hi>Antidote;</hi> take down the <hi>antidote</hi> of Humility, againſt the <hi>poyſon</hi> of Pride; of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> againſt <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> of <hi>Zeal,</hi> againſt
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy.</hi> It is eaſier to <hi>keep</hi> ſin out of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than to
<hi>caſt</hi> it out when in. The Devil is a <hi>fiery Serpent,</hi> and if he can but get in his
<hi>head,</hi> he will get in his whole <hi>body,</hi> and if he do not, yet the <hi>ſting</hi> is in his <hi>head. How many virgin Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have loſt their ſpiritual chaſtity in an hour, that they have been procuring many years? and that dear peace of Conſcience in a moment, that they have not imbraced again till eternity?</hi> But alas! while we ſhould give
<hi>cordials</hi> to others, we <hi>faint</hi> our ſelves; we ſhould <hi>awaken</hi> others, and we <hi>ſleep</hi> our ſelves; we ſhould <hi>uphold</hi> others, and we <hi>fall</hi> our ſelves; we ſhould help to <hi>revive</hi> others, and we are <hi>dead.</hi> Many that have time to <hi>reprove</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe others, have not <hi>hearts,</hi> many that have <hi>hearts,</hi> have not <hi>time,</hi> their own hearts are ſo out of frame and tune. Like <hi>dying</hi> men we take hold of one another, and we love to <hi>periſh</hi> in company. But Chriſtians,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſe,</hi> and prepare for the coming of your Maſter, for as it is <hi>certain,</hi> ſo it will be <hi>ſudden.</hi> If it were the <hi>laſt hour</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, ſure now it is the <hi>laſt minute</hi> of that laſt hour. Oh Lord!
<pb facs="tcp:170036:11"/> never was the <hi>Judge</hi> nigher to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and never leſs preparation for his coming. Chriſtians, have we not <hi>Cloſets</hi> to mourn in, or rather do not we want hearts to mourn with all? Hath Chriſt caſt his Cloak of love over you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaid,
<hi>live,</hi> and will you not pitty thoſe that yet lie as it were dead in their blood? if you have any <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> adviſe; any <hi>Faith,</hi> pray; any <hi>Zeal,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor; any
<hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſoberly wait; for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord draws nigh. How can Chriſt wipe tears from our eyes, if we never wept for his abſence? or come to anſwer our prayers, if we never pray for his coming. <hi>Awake, awake,</hi> the night is far ſpent; ariſe, the <hi>Day ſtar</hi> is riſen in the world, we have ſlept too long already; Endeavor that when the
<hi>Father</hi> comes, he may not find you, like <hi>Prodigals,</hi> out of his <hi>houſe;</hi> that when the <hi>Captain</hi> of your Salvation comes, he may not find you in the
<hi>Trenches</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or of the World, a Lying, a Swearing, a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your fellow Brethren, for even to theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſins our natures are inclineable. <hi>Pray, Pray,</hi> That when the <hi>Judge</hi> comes, <hi>who is even at the door,</hi> that you may not have your
<hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts</hi> to be <hi>caſt up,</hi> when they are to be <hi>given up;</hi> Judge your ſelves that you may not be judged. The <hi>noiſe</hi> and <hi>news</hi> of the
<hi>Bridegrooms</hi> approach is at hand; Awake, ariſe, <hi>go ye out to
<pb facs="tcp:170036:12"/> meet him.</hi> If theſe following Diſcourſes may any way advantage you in your ſpiritual Watch againſt the Devil, they are yours, read them in love, apply them to experience, let them not ſwim in your heads, but ſink into your hearts; And in your prayers to the
<hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> let him have a room, who ſubſcribes himſelf in our Lord Jeſus,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a threefold ſenſe of this Viſion, literall, allegorical and providentiall.</p>
                  <p>Firſt literall The Hiſtory of <hi>Jacob</hi> conſiſts of three gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:170036:13"/>Firſt, <hi>Jacobs</hi> going to <hi>Padan Aran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, his ſtay there,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his return from thence.</p>
                  <p>In his going to <hi>Padan Aran,</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which induced him to go thither are recorded; which were, to take a wife of his own kindred, and that hee might withdraw himſelf from the fury of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged brother.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the accidents that fell out by the <hi>providence of God</hi> in his journey, and theſe were, the <hi>Viſion of the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> his conſecration of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and his vow, all contained in this chapter; my purpoſe is only to paraphraſe and apply the <hi>Viſion of Jacobs Ladder.</hi> The Lord open this <hi>Viſion</hi> to our eies to ſee it, and open our eies to ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Four things might perplex <hi>Jacob</hi> in this journey, That he ſhould leave his Country, that hee ſhould forſake his friends, that hee might fall into pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, laſtly, ſolitarineſſe and want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; wherefore the Lord ſeaſonably appears to <hi>Jacob in this Viſion;</hi> though thou leaveſt thy country, yet be content, I will not leave thee, and as for thy friends, be not troubled, I am thy friend, can you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170036:13"/> mend your ſelf <hi>Jacob?</hi> and for ſhame fear not poverty, if the word of thy God may be taken, eaſt and weſt ſhall be at thy command. Let <hi>Jacob</hi> ſay, certainly I ſhall never ſee God want, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould I be diſmayed, ſeeing the Lord ſaith, I will never ſee <hi>Jacob</hi> want; and let not <hi>Jacob</hi> fear to be alone, for <hi>Angells</hi> ſhall travell with him, and that which is ſecurity enough, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhal have in company not only the <hi>Angells</hi> of God, but the God of <hi>Angells.</hi> The
<hi>Ladder</hi> is the journey of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the <hi>Angells aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending and deſcending,</hi> his royal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, going to &amp; returning with him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Padan Aran;</hi> the Lord <hi>ſtands on the top of the Ladder</hi> as guiding and governing all.
<hi>Jacob</hi> I am perſwaded never had a ſweeter nights lodging than at this time, when the ſtones were his pillow, and the Heavens his canopy, when <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> made his bed, and
<hi>Angells</hi> rockt the cradle. How pleaſant is it to conſider! <hi>Angells</hi> guard
<hi>Jacob,</hi> God guards the <hi>Angells,</hi> and God guards <hi>Jacob</hi> with
<hi>Angells;</hi> what ground then hath <hi>Jacob</hi> to fear either men or Devills to diſturb him, when hee hath a guard of God and of his <hi>Angells?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170036:14"/>Secondly an Allegorical ſenſe; and ſo Chriſt is this <hi>Ladder (John</hi> I. <hi>ult.)</hi> by his Divine nature he reached to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by his humane to the earth, his incarnation being a commerce between Divinity and humanity; <hi>the ſteps of this Ladder</hi> are either the genealogy of Chriſt, or the ſucceſſive works of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
<hi>John</hi> the tenth, Hee that <hi>climbs</hi> up, or thinks to <hi>climb</hi> up, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to heaven than by this <hi>Ladder,</hi> is a thief; for <hi>John</hi> the 14. hee is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way for ſatisfaction, for juſtification, for ſanctification, the only way from God to man, and from Man to God; every poor ſinner hath liberty <hi>to aſcend</hi> theſe
<hi>ſtairs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tolle ſcalas <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii,</hi> &amp; tu ſolus Coelum introi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.</note> and the righteous Phariſee ſhall never enter the ſtar-chamber of heaven at a backdore.</p>
                  <p>Every man by nature ſees the neceſſity of ſome <hi>Ladder</hi> or other to <hi>climb up</hi> to ſalvation by; the Mahumetan makes the Alcoran his <hi>Ladder;</hi> the Jew makes the Temple of the Lord his <hi>Ladder;</hi> the carnal Proteſtant makes his char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty his <hi>Ladder,</hi> and the Papiſt hath his <hi>Ladder</hi> alſo; there is a <hi>Red Ladder</hi> by the blood of Chriſt, but they will have a <hi>White
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170036:14"/> Ladder</hi> by <hi>Marys</hi> obedience; this they accompt the eaſier way; mee thinks theſe men miſtake <hi>Jacobs Ladder,</hi> yet ſomething like it is, for they are in a <hi>dream as Jacob was;</hi> theſe are all rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Ladders,</hi> and the
<hi>climbers</hi> have rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hearts,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A <hi>Providentiall</hi> ſenſe, and thus I ſhall handle this <hi>Viſion.</hi> The <hi>Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſignifies the Divine <hi>Providence,</hi> and in this <hi>Ladder,</hi> wee have many things obſervable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, The variety of Providence in the many ſteps. The Providence of God hath indeed but one end, yet it hath divers waies to that one end;</hi> every living creature hath four faces and four wings, to ſignify the ſeveral appearances and ſwift execution of <hi>Providence. Eze.</hi> 1.6. It is a difficult thing to take the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Providence</hi> at this time in the world, it maketh and hath ſo many faces, let our eyes be never ſo exact in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and our hands ready in deſcribing its waies. The locks of the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> are black and curled, black for their obſcurity, and curled for their various intricacy.
<hi>There are not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170036:15"/> ſeveral countenances of men, as there are diſpenſations of God, and its as rare a thing to find diſpenſations, as men, of the ſame complexion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In heaven God will appear to the Saints in one glorious form, but now, as it was ſaid of an Emperor, that every day he put on a new ſuit, ſo it is the Lords honour to apparell himſelf in changeable robes; the imbroidery of <hi>Providence</hi> is made up of divers colours;
<hi>Sion</hi> is not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in one condition, nor the ſoul all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in one poſture; ſometimes Chriſt frowns, and ſometimes he ſmiles, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee caſteth down, ſometimes hee lifteth up, ſometimes the Church of God is in the wilderneſſe, ſometimes in
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> ſometimes on the raging ſea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in her harbour. <hi>The Lord keeps his people from infection by leading them into divers aires;</hi> black and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Providences</hi> ſet off the wiſdome and faithfullneſſe of our God the better. Standing waters corrupt and breed noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome creatures, but running waters are pure and preſervative. Every new day brings with it a new tentation, <hi>and wee ſhall never be experienced Souldiers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170036:15"/> till we are tryed at all ſorts of weapons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Credend a plura ſunt de Deo quam ſcienda.</note> We muſt not look on the ſcattered lines of
<hi>Providence,</hi> but tarry till God hath made a concluſion; <hi>never ſay Providence ſcribles, til you have ſeen the whole copy.</hi> Princes letters wee ſay, ought to bee read thrice; Let us conſider the waies of God, and wee ſhall never cenſure them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In this <hi>Ladder</hi> we have <hi>the ſeeming uncertainty of Providence; The Ladder is partly above the Clouds, and partly viſible in the Air;</hi> as the Spirit,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. blows where it liſteth, ſo God in his works, worketh how he liſteth. It is obſervable, that uſually of old, when God appeared in the Tabernacle, a Cloud uſhered in his preſence. <hi>All the world is in the light to God, but God is in the dark to all the world.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord walks ſo plainly in his works, that he that runs may read; that the dim-ſighted'ſt Chriſtian may ſay, this is the Lords <hi>walk,</hi> and this is the Lords
<hi>work;</hi> at other times, he wraps himſelf in a cloud,<note place="margin">Si vides, ubi fides</note> and overcaſteth <hi>Syon</hi> with darkneſs, that the poor children of God cannot tell where to find their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they can but gueſſe at his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, knowing not which way to march,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170036:16"/> for their Leader hath hid himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great ſaid, when the ſcales weighed down on <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſide, that there was a miſt on the eies of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> but indeed, the Sun ſhone clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the miſt was on his eye that he could not ſee it. I confeſs, in this age it <hi>is eaſier to know what particular things in Providence God will pull down, than what he will ſet up. We often imagine there is a diſorder in Gods works, when, if we mind it, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order is in our imagination; We know not how to beleeve, and we phancy the Lord to be at a ſtand, as not knowing what to do: But we muſt take heed of charging the Lord to be out of his way when onely he is out of our ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In this <hi>Ladder</hi> we have <hi>the ſeeming contradictions of Providence; The Angels aſcend and deſcend the Ladder,</hi> One <hi>Providence</hi> ſeems to go one way, and another <hi>Providence</hi> ſeems to go another way. Sometime the <hi>Cloud</hi> in the wilderneſs ſeemed to carry <hi>Iſrael</hi> immediately to <hi>Canaan;</hi> now for
<hi>Canaan</hi> might <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron</hi> ſay; and on a ſudden the Lord wheels about, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> turns faces
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170036:16"/> toward the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> as if he intended they ſhould never ſee
<hi>Canaan</hi> more.</p>
                  <p>How plainly hath the Lord led <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for ſome years toward a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? The Saints have encouragingly ſaid one to another, Certainly we are within two or three years journey of the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> Have at the ſcarlet Whore of <hi>Babylon;</hi> Now for the building of ruinate <hi>Sion;</hi> But the Lord hath ſeemed to cry, <hi>face about,</hi> and follow me yet longer in the wilderneſs, and ſome of the Saints conclude, we are never like to go forward, we ſhall return to our Leeks and Onyons; The converſion of ſouls viſibly goes backward and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. About twelve years ago hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds came out of the <hi>Devils Kingdom,</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom of the Goſpel,</hi> but now many fly from the colours of the Goſpell viſibly,<note place="margin">Miremur non rimemur Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae recondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> and run into the Devils quarters again. The Lord ſeems to ſeal up the hardneſs of mens hearts, and to ſay to the womb of Grace, Give forth no more, let no more ſinners be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from darkneſs to light in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well might <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 30.19. compare <hi>the Church to a ſhip in the midſt of the Sea;</hi> which as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170036:17"/> ſpeaks, <hi>Now even mounts up to the Heavens, and anon deſcends, as it were, to Hell.</hi> God ſees our works in our wills, but we cannot many times ſpell out the Lords Will by his Works; who can trace the Lord in his travel, or find out the <hi>work</hi> or
<hi>walk</hi> of the Almighty in the world? <hi>The Texts of Providence are as difficult as the Texts of the Scriptures; there are as high conteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Providence, as about Predeſtination, and it is as hard to reconcile the Works of God, as to reconcile his Word, though there is a real concordance and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be not over righteous,</hi> ſays the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.16. Can a man be too righteous? rather, we think, he ſhould have ſaid, be not too prophane; but as one Diamond cuts another, ſo one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture opens another, ver. 15. <hi>I have ſeen a juſt man,</hi> as juſt as <hi>Abel, periſh in his righteouſnes,</hi> and to loſe his life becauſe he would keep his conſcience; and on the contrary, <hi>I have ſeen a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man,</hi> as wicked as <hi>Cain, to prolong his life,</hi> and to have the world at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: but yet carp not at providence,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170036:17"/> let the Lord be down before you think to lift him up; enter not into the Chair to offer knowledge to God about his Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no reaſon that the Lord ſhould give man a reaſon of all his ways; he often wils a change, but never changeth his will.</hi> God may retreat in his <hi>Providences,</hi> as to us, and undo all he hath been doing in <hi>England</hi> theſe fifteen years, and make
<hi>Sion</hi> put on her mourning apparel, and yet not be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unconſtant or unfaithful; though I hope better things.</p>
                  <p>For it is obſerveable, that <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in the main is never Excentrical, and in the main is never Retrograde, <hi>The Lord oft looks backward, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes backward. He led</hi> Iſrael <hi>forty years about in the wilderneſs, and yet never carried them back to</hi> Egypt.
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is promiſed a Son, and a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous off-ſpring; but as if <hi>Providence</hi> had forgot it ſelf (to us) <hi>Abraham</hi> is commanded to offer up <hi>Iſaack;</hi> and whereas he might have objected, Lord, thou art wont to call for Oxen to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and doſt thou require me to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170036:18"/> ſacrifice my ſon? Thy word ſaith, I muſt not kill,<note place="margin">Certum eſt quia impoſsibile eſt.</note> and thy mouth ſaith, I muſt kill: and Lord, thou haſt promiſed to multiply my ſeed, and now thou calleſt for my
<hi>Iſaack?</hi> How can the <hi>bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> grow if the <hi>ſtock</hi> be cut down? and yet
<hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed, winking, and putting his hand into the Lords hand, following him, though
<hi>Providence,</hi> as it were, croſſed the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> We now have, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>a wheel in a wheel:</hi> So I truſt, ere God hath done with <hi>England,</hi> we ſhall have, as the Rabbi ſpeaks, <hi>a miracle in a miracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In this <hi>Ladder,</hi> we have <hi>The independency of Providence. The Ladder, we ſee, is onely reared and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by God; it is not a crooked Ladder, but ſtands upright toward Heaven.</hi> It <hi>Leans</hi> not on the mountains of men, nor Palaces of Kings. Many quarrel and find fault with the <hi>Ladder of Providence,</hi> but this <hi>Ladder</hi> ſhall
<hi>never fall down before</hi> man, or <hi>to</hi> man. The Prophet undertakes the challenge,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15. <hi>Who hath been the Counſeller of God, or hath taught
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170036:18"/> the Almighty?</hi> The <hi>wiſe</hi> King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> was ſo
<hi>fooliſh,</hi> as to think he could have made the <hi>Creation</hi> better if he had been of Gods Counſel; and ſome men think there are <hi>Erratae's</hi> in the volume of
<hi>Providence,</hi> by their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, and would fain be a <hi>correcting</hi> the Lords
<hi>Copy,</hi> and <hi>amending</hi> the <hi>Lines</hi> of his Government in the world; methinks falſe-hearted man is like flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <hi>Abſolom</hi> who would inſinuate to the people neglects in his Fathers Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; There is no man deputed of the King to do Juſtice, and that he was able to guide <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a better order.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>John</hi> the 15. The Church is compared to <hi>a Vine,</hi> and God will have it
<hi>lean</hi> on himſelf, and not to be <hi>ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by the <hi>poles and policy</hi> of men. <hi>It is obſerved that the weakeſt women have often the ſtrongeſt children, and that the Lord hangs the heavieſt weights on the ſmalleſt wyars. The ſtone in</hi> Daniel <hi>is cut out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains without hands:</hi> The Goſpel and <hi>Sion</hi> are neither framed nor forged by man, both are the handy-works of God; <hi>as there was no concurrence of mans
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170036:19"/> power to the generation of Chriſt perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; ſo there is no concurrence of the wiſdom of man, to the generation of Chriſt myſtical. Cicero</hi> fell in with
<hi>Caeſar</hi> when <hi>Pompey</hi> was defeated; and it is no diſhonor for man,
<hi>routed</hi> in his way, to <hi>fall down</hi> to God. Man muſt lean on God, but God will never lean on man; man muſt go to God, God will never come to man. If the <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> will not come to <hi>Mahumet, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet</hi> will go to the <hi>Mountain,</hi> ſaid that bold Impoſtor, when he could not work a <hi>miracle,</hi> which he promiſed to his followers.
<hi>Oecolampadius</hi> had a good <hi>cauſe,</hi> as they ſaid, but he wanted
<hi>Souldiers</hi> to bear it up; but let <hi>Sion</hi> remember that her cauſe is not ſo good, but the ſtrength of her <hi>Protector</hi> is as great to maintain it:<note place="margin">Quod eſt cauſa cauſae, eſt cauſa cauſati.</note> 
                     <hi>There is nothing that God doth by the creature, but he can do without the creature; rather than</hi> Sion <hi>ſhall fall, the God of</hi> Sion <hi>will not ſtand on miracles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In this <hi>Ladder</hi> we have <hi>the extent of Providence. The Ladder is ſet upon the earth, and the top of it reached to Heaven, Providence extends,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170036:19"/>1 To all ſenſeleſs and irrational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both in their Preſervation and Government. Firſt,<note place="margin">Virtus eſt maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma pertingere quam remotiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae.</note> In their Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Epicures</hi> confine God to the Palace of Heaven, as if it were below his Majeſty to take notice of the lower world; The
<hi>Stoicks</hi> limit him to the middle Region: But the Lord deals not like a Carpenter or
<hi>Artizan,</hi> who have done all their work when a houſe is built, and a Clock put together.
<hi>There is as much need of a Divine wiſdom to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as there was of a Divine power to make the world.</hi> There is a neceſſity not onely of a privative influx from God, that is, not onely that he does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his creatures, but of a poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to maintain the creatures in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Job</hi> 6.9. If the Lord <hi>take away his hand,</hi> Job <hi>would fall;</hi> not onely to the ground, but alſo to his firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mithridates</hi> a General knew all the names of all the Souldiers in his Army; The Heavens are the <hi>Lords Hoſts,</hi> and they in all their <hi>rancks</hi> and orbes are known and kept by <hi>the Lord of Hoſts. Cincinnatus</hi> his honor was, at the ſame
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170036:20"/> time to hold the <hi>Plow,</hi> and the <hi>Helm</hi> of State. <hi>The Lord made as well the leaſt worm on earth, as the moſt glorious Angel in Heaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deus nec laborat in maximis, nec faſtidit in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</note>

<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would be as full of <hi>Judgements</hi> as it is of <hi>Sin,</hi> if men were the Makers and Maſters of Judgements.

In the deſcription of a <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> in paper, though the circle bee brought within one inch of finiſhing, yet, if the compaſs be removed, a man can never make a perfect circle, but muſt begin all again to find out the ſame center. If the Lord ſhould ceaſe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his works of <hi>Providence, Sion</hi> would run to ruin, and God would be put to the labor of working a new.</p>
                  <p>The Eighth remarkable <hi>in this Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, The gradation of Providence: Here is a climax of Providences, one ſtep above another in the Ladder.</hi>

                  <p>As firſt, In a ſpiritual ſenſe; As in the natural birth there be many preparations, but the birth is in a moment; ſo in Grace, there are many diſpoſitions to Grace, as ſenſe of ſin, mourning, and deſires, which yet I dare not call formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170036:48"/> Grace, though the former alwaies, and the laſt moſtly goe <hi>before Grace,</hi> and by ſome to their ruin, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or miſtaken for <hi>Grace:</hi> but Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration it ſelf, is in a moment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.7. <hi>The Saints go from ſtrength to ſtrength;</hi> from one vertue to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: There is an alluſion to the
<hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> journying yearly to the Temple, they went from City to City before they came to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> or to Schools of learning, where there is going from one form to another, from one Science to another. <hi>The martyr it ſeems numbred his ſteps, one ſtile more, and I am at my Fathers houſe, that is, at the top of</hi> Jacobs <hi>Ladder.</hi> The Lord formerly in the wilderneſs carried, and now carrys <hi>Sion</hi> from one Mile-poſt to another, from one Stage to another. <hi>Ebenezra,</hi>

                  <p>So in a more publick ſenſe, <hi>Rome was not built in a day, neither will</hi> Rome <hi>be pulled down in a day;</hi> indeed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170036:49"/> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.17. it is ſaid, <hi>in one hour ſo great riches are come to nought;</hi> but that is as the Husbandman chalks a line about a ſere Tree which he intends to have for firing, he fetches many a blow, and yet the Tree ſtands ſtill, but at laſt one ſound blow fell the Tree; <hi>Providence</hi> hath fetcht many a blow at the
<hi>Scarlet Whore,</hi> but her <hi>climacterical day</hi> is at hand, her <hi>critical day</hi> is at hand and then ſhe ſhall fall, fully, finally, fatally. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> hitherto hath moſtly been but a lopping the <hi>branches,</hi> but now the Axe is laid to the very root of
<hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any wonder why the ruin of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Letter</hi> goes on no faſter. I Anſwer, <hi>The Devil and Pope</hi> muſt in ſome ſenſe fall together, for they have ſupported one anothers Cauſe; now and then <hi>Providence</hi> fetcheth a blow at the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and ſeems as if he gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the work, becauſe in the reſpite he is ſtriking at the <hi>Devil;</hi> So the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> keep pace together, and therefore the work ſeems to be ſo long a doing.
<hi>There are various ſteps in one Ladder,</hi> and we muſt neither appoint the Lord
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170036:49"/> which way to walk, nor what ſteps to fetch; be not diſcouraged, God works gradually, and alſo he works certainly. What courſe ſoever <hi>Providence</hi> ſteers, he will not miſs a point of his Divine Compaſs; but at length, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all winds and waves of men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, the Church ſhal arrive at her harbor.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 You may have a ſight upward and downward. As our Lord and Maſter ſaid

                     </note> Riches and Honors are not Heaven; Heaven is of another colour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Be Star-gazers in a ſpiritual ſenſe, <hi>climb to the top of Jacobs Ladder.</hi> How <hi>little</hi> would the world ſeem to us, if the
<hi>great</hi> God were not <hi>little</hi> in us? who ever took a proſpect of Heaven, and did not fall in love with it? and who ever loved Heaven, that never took a proſpect of it? Either Heaven will take us off from viewing the World, or the World will take us off from viewing Heaven. The World would ſeem no ſuch peece of glory, if the Glory that ſhines on the <hi>top of the Ladder</hi> were but unfolded to us. They ſay, <hi>Naples</hi> is a City to be ſeen onely on

                     <hi>Jacobs Ladder</hi> is as ſweet a repaſt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> his

Some Mountains in the World are above the Clouds, and Storms, and Winds; what a glorious thing is it to contemplate Eternity, and every day with

                  <p>Second <hi>Proſpect from this Ladder;</hi> we may look backward and forward, and notwithſtanding all our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unthankfulneſs, ſee what God hath done for
<hi>England,</hi> and will do for <hi>Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, We may look backward, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That we are not made a <hi>Sodom. If the preaching of the Goſpel lift a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170036:71"/> Nation up to Heaven, then certainly</hi> England <hi>is not upon the Earth,</hi> Matth. 11.23. <hi>The ſin of</hi> Sodom <hi>was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of bread;</hi> Their ſin was not plenty of bread, but emptineſs of obedience. <hi>England,</hi> I fear, is guilty of a
<hi>Goſpel Surfet;</hi> And might not the Lord juſtly take us down, and make us know the
<hi>worth</hi> of the Goſpel, by the want of it? Since we have plaid with the <hi>light</hi> of Truth, might he not make us feel the <hi>fire?</hi> Might not God lay down his <hi>Basket,</hi> and take up his <hi>Ax,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not fit for fruit, and <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> make us fit fuel for <hi>burning?</hi> Have not the Ambaſſadors of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel had as hard <hi>lot</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as they had in <hi>Sodom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who cannot but admire, that when <hi>England</hi> is as <hi>chaffy</hi> as <hi>Sodom,</hi> that we ave not the ſame <hi>flames</hi> as <hi>Sodom</hi> had? Is not this ſalvation, that when wee have been weary of God, that yet God is not weary of us? That when we have refuſed to be a
<hi>holy Nation,</hi> that yet we are a Nation? That when our <hi>ſins</hi> are the ſins of
<hi>Sodom,</hi> that our <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> are not the ſufferings of <hi>Sodom?
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170036:72"/> God hath lighted up a flaming Candle of Juſtice in</hi> Sodom, <hi>the Lord grant that luke-warm</hi> England <hi>may yet ſee to read her ſalvation by it?</hi> Mercy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>ſwims</hi> in <hi>Juſtice;</hi> but with us, <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſeems to be
<hi>drowned</hi> in <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>From this Ladder admire,</hi> that we are not made an <hi>Egypt.</hi> God lately turned our waters into blood, our Sea was then a <hi>red Sea</hi> indeed. What a mercy is it, that
<hi>Engliſh darkneſs</hi> is not a proverb as well as <hi>Egyptian darkneſs. England,</hi> of old, was called <hi>Albion,</hi> from the <hi>white Rocks,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (as ſome Criticks fancy) ſignifies a Land of darkneſs; But how quickly can the Lord turn <hi>Albion</hi> into <hi>Scotia, England</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England?</hi> we are their neighbors already.</p>
                  <p>We have much liberty to bleſs God, Oh that there we not ſo much liberty to blaſpheme God! We have more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than either we have deſerved or been thankful for. <hi>There was a time when the Saints in</hi> England <hi>had Conſcience without liberty, we have now much
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170036:72"/> liberty of Conſcience, the Lord grant the time may never come that we ſhould have liberty without Conſcience; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and nothing elſe but Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Atheiſm.</hi> We had once <hi>hearts</hi> to bleſs God, but wanted <hi>opportunity,</hi> Oh that now we have opportunities we did not want hearts! As when a doubting Chriſtian complained that he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, he was ſuch a ſtranger to God, a Preacher of the Goſpel replied, But what will you take for that intereſt, though as you think little, you have in God? not a thouſand worlds, ſaid the doubting Chriſtian: <hi>Saints in</hi> England, <hi>what will you take for that liberty you have?</hi> Now your eyes ſee your Teachers, what if they were all ſhut up in corners? now the doors of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations <hi>(q.d.)</hi> are open, what if it were paſt Sermon-time, and paſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance-time? what if the ſilver bell of the Goſpel ſhould no more ſound in <hi>England? Oh that we had as much conſcience of liberty, as we have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience!</hi> That of <hi>Omnium Deorum,</hi> among the Romans; of <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Sanctorum,</hi> amongſt the Papiſts:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170036:73"/> of <hi>Omnium Sectarum,</hi> here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are monſtrous. Every variation from unity is a ſtep to nullity. <hi>If ever</hi> England <hi>ſhould come from one Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all (and we are in the high way) we ſhall quickly go from all Religion to none.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>From this Ladder admire,</hi> that we are not made a <hi>Germany;</hi> Inſtead of the ſword of War, you have the Scepter of Peace; inſtead of Garments rowled in blood, and the noyſe of Arms, you have the blood of Chriſt ſprinkled on your Garments, Oh trample it not under feet; Inſtead of the roaring Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, you have the ſweet ſound of Goſpel-Ordinances.
<hi>God hath but ſhaken his rod over us, while he hath broken their backs; while we have been let blood, he hath even let them bleed to death.</hi> God bid <hi>David</hi> chuſe which of the three plagues, of War, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Peſtilence, he would have; but God puts it to our choyce which of thoſe three plagues we will not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on us; <hi>Though God hath ſheathed up his ſword, yet he holds it ſtill in his hand, therefore fear;</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170036:73"/> What ſalvation is this, that parents are not drinking the blood of their ch ldren, to quench their thirſt; and eat the fleſh of their children, to ſatisfie their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>From hence admire,</hi> that we are not made a <hi>Babylon.</hi> Pray, pray that the Bibles may be <hi>opened</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and yet bleſs God that there are not
<hi>Pad-locks</hi> hung on them in <hi>England.</hi> Pray migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> may fall abroad, and forget not to <hi>bleſs God, that though there be much of</hi> Rome <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>that yet</hi> England <hi>is not</hi> Rome, that none can go to Market that none can buy or ſel, without the mark of the Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.17. either in their right hands, or on their foreheads.</p>
                  <p>It is the opinion of ſome good men, that the Proteſtant Profeſſion ſhall be over-ſpread with <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> again, and that then the Lord will extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily awaken them from their ſleep, and actively engage them againſt
<hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> But I wiſh, though we have looked on <hi>Babylon,</hi> that we may not ſo
<hi>luſt</hi> after <hi>Babylon;</hi> Spiritual longings in this kind are dangerous, but I hope God will
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170036:74"/> prevent <hi>Sions</hi> miſcarriage in the birth of <hi>Reformation.</hi> The Lord grant, if we go to <hi>Rome,</hi> it may not be to dote on her, but to deſtroy her.
<hi>There is an old Prophecy, that Antichrist ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overcome</hi> Paris, <hi>nor</hi> Venice, <hi>nor</hi> London; <hi>Let us not be ſecure, for if his Soul have entertainment here, his Body will not tarry long after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>What Salvation hath the Lord wrought for us? what fruit is there of all the blood ſhed in</hi> England? <hi>is not our condition as bad as ever, nay, in ſome ſenſe worſe? the Saints were united, are they not now divided? how many Profeſſors are turned Apoſtates, nay Perſecutors and Prophane?</hi> This is ſad indeed, and to be lamented; yet, as the Diſciples did not wiſh the blood in Chriſts veins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, though they were diſtreſſed by his death; So I dare not ſay, though in our Diſtractions, and among the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this age, <hi>Man hath loſt his way, that God hath loſt his end.</hi> This is the ſupport, That as God hath laid the Foundation, ſo he will carry on the Building; that as the Great Turk
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170036:74"/> makes a Bridge of the Bodies of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſcale the wals of a Garriſon; So the Lord <hi>knows how to make his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to riſe, by the fall of ours, and to give life to his Cauſe, by the death of his followers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From this Ladder</hi> we may take many ſweet <hi>Proſpects</hi> forward, on what God will do more apparently for <hi>Sion</hi> in the world. There are eight fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Proſpects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Proſpect from Jacobs Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is,</hi> Gods <hi>Jacobs</hi> may foreſee the abundance of knowledge yet to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36 26. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.8.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. <hi>Knowledge ſhall abound as waters do upon the Sea.</hi> Knowledge is now but at a low Ebb, in compariſon of that high Tide that ſhal flow hereafter. Knowledge ſhall abound as the Sea intenſively and extenſively, it ſhall more increaſe, and be more clear. As a Dwarf ſtanding on the ſhoulders of a tall man ſees further than the tall man, on whoſe ſhoulders he ſtands: So I am perſwaded, <hi>in ſome things, that the men of knowledge in this age will be but children in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the next.</hi> Jer. 31.34. <hi>They
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170036:75"/> ſhall not teach one another ſaying, know the Lord.</hi> Then farewell preaching. No, the Saints ſhall need to be built up, but they ſhall not ſo much need to be taught the Principles of Religion ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Exprimere non valet experimento opus eſt. Cathedram in coelo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet qui cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da docet.</note> 
                     <hi>Know the Lord,</hi> What is God; the new nature ſhall teach them that, which is not the impreſſion of Man, but of God; They ſhall ſay, Our Father, and I Beleeve, by roat.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that under the Law the <hi>Girdle</hi> was <hi>about the Loyns, Ezek</hi>
23.15. But in Goſpel times it is <hi>about the Paps,</hi> Rev. 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>3. to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, how knowledge ſhall riſe h gher in the laſt ages of the world, than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. <hi>Young men ſhall ſee viſions, and old men ſhall dream dreams.</hi> The old world did but dream, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Jews is more dark, but in Goſpel-daies there ſhall be Viſions, a clearer knowledge and Revelation of the mind of God. Antichriſt hath brought a cloud into the Temple, and the Goſpel Sun-ſhine muſt expel it. Providence is picking quarrels with the painted windows of Antichriſt and the Lord will ſet up clear glaſs windows that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170036:75"/> ſhall not keep out the light. <hi>Not that we are to expect new Truths, but new <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings; not the printing of a new Gospel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☜</note>
                     <hi>or making any more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; but new eye-ſight, and the downfal of old error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How is it poſſible that amongſt us any ſhould plead for <hi>Revelations,</hi> when we have the <hi>revealed Word?</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were more ſuitable to the days of the Law, we have a compleat copy of the Lords mind for the Government of his Church in the Word; but it is as with man, the older he grows the more inclinable he is to dreams:<note place="margin">Mundus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſcens pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſiam.</note> the old world begins to doat, and we are ready to neglect our watch in this <hi>dreaming</hi> age.</p>
                  <p>Second <hi>Proſpect from this Ladder,</hi> we may foreſee the encreaſe of holineſs. Now many can profeſs and be drunk, profeſs and ſwear, and lie; now men are more careful for new
<hi>Lights</hi> than new <hi>Lives:</hi> new <hi>Notions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gnoſtici ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal &amp; Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boritae.</note> than new <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the Spirit, <hi>Care more to have a Library of Divinity in their brains, than a Catechiſm of Divinity in their hearts:</hi> Have the light of the Sun for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170036:76"/> Knowledge, whereas they have not the heat of a candle for Holineſs; like the Toad, that has a precious pearl in the Head, but poyſon in the Bowels; or like the Lapwing, that hath a Coronet on her head, but always feeds on dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils.</p>
                  <p>But there is a time a coming when men ſhall more viſibly honor God,—<hi>All the pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and holineſs ſhall be wrote on the bels of the horſes,</hi> Zech. <hi>ult.</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit holineſs vaniſheth, the more real holineſs appears. At <hi>Rome</hi> there was a <hi>Pantheon</hi> or <hi>Temple</hi> for all gods, but the Heathen would not ſuffer <hi>Jehovah</hi> to be worſhipped there, for he is a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, and if he had been honored, then down with <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> (I wiſh none have <hi>Kingly</hi> thoughts of that <hi>Kingdom</hi>) the Kingdom of Chriſt, and holineſs, and humility, and Mortification. It is not the throwing down of prophane Miniſters, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Magiſtrates onely, will be this Kingdom; for they may be thrown down, and yet Chriſt never be ſet up;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170036:76"/> the new Creature, Self-denial, will after all this be neceſſary, <hi>for otherwiſe we ſhould have rather</hi> Plato's <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or</hi> Tully's <hi>Offices, than Chriſts Kingdom. Moral Prophaneneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed lays the Goſpel on the dunghill, but Moral Holineſs ſimply will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet Chriſt in his Throne. There ſhall be an high-way, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs, and no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing ſhall paſs therein,</hi> Iſa.
53. If any demand how this can be? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, no diſeaſe is incurable to an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>Third <hi>Proſpect from this Ladder;</hi> we may ſee Hypocriſie defeated, and many Apoſtates recovered. Now many deſire rather to appear than to be holy; <hi>they account the form neceſſary, but the power of Religion burthenſom;</hi> Now many like Rowers in a Boat, look one way and row another; <hi>Now many have no greater ends by Religion, than in the end to be great in Religion;</hi> But <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> is a pulling off the vizard, and making the hearts of men to appear in their faces: Many ſhal not only not dance in a net unſeen of heaven, but not in a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170036:77"/> net unſeen of men. Their folly ſhall be made known to all men. <hi>God will light up candles in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and enkindle a fire in</hi> Sion, and Hypocriſie ſhall not indure either the light or heat; and God will alſo make profeſſors, like
<hi>Moſes, Act.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Not onely mighty in words,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Craſsiani non Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani.</note> 
                     <hi>that are no bodies in deeds, but alſo mighty in word and in deeds;</hi> like <hi>Aarons rod,</hi> not onely to bring forth bloſſoms of profeſſion, but Almonds, fruits of holineſs; Like the High Prieſt, not onely to have <hi>Bels,</hi> but
<hi>Pomegranates,</hi> not onely to bear away the bell for knowledge, but to give a ſweet ſcent of the Spirit in their converſations.</p>
                  <p>Many poor ſinners of late have left their <hi>Fathers houſe,</hi> and becauſe of their guilty conſciences, would, for the preſent, if they could, run out of their <hi>Fathers eye,</hi> as well as his houſe; and who ſhall return the <hi>Prodigal</hi> to his <hi>Father, Hagar</hi> to her <hi>Miſtris, Jonah</hi> to his <hi>God</hi> again? how do many Profeſſors fly like ſpiritual malefactors from one form to another,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Fourth <hi>Proſpect from this Ladder;</hi> hence we may ſee the reconciliation of Diviſions. <hi>Now Ephraim is againſt Manaſſeh, and Manaſſeh againſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, and both againſt Judah;</hi> now diviſions are not onely between Wolves
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170036:78"/> and Wolves, <hi>but between ſheep and ſheep, Saint and Saint; Formerly we had more fire than light, but the Lord knows, now we have more light than fire; more Knowledge than Love. Every man pretends to be of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Faith,</hi>

How far are thoſe from one another, that yet I hope, are nigh to God?

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Neither is it neceſſary there ſhould be an <hi>immediate</hi> power from Chriſt, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> to <hi>preſerve</hi> and perſevere the Saints in glory. For
<hi>everlaſting glory</hi> is the purchaſe of his death as well as glory. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Though their glory is not <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> yet the firſt <hi>ſeizure</hi> of glory is
<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> in glory; Glory, and eternall glory, differing not in <hi>kind,</hi> poſſibly not in real <hi>degree;</hi> There being properly no <hi>poſterius</hi> in Heaven, or <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of hours. Heaven is an <hi>eternal</hi>

                     </gap>. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The <hi>immediate</hi> preſence of God is a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170036:93"/> a ſufficient ground of their preſervation. Fourthly, Why is the
<hi>mediation</hi> of Chriſt made eternal <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> by any, rather than eternal <hi>à parte ante?</hi> or rather thus, why may not the <hi>merit</hi> of our
<hi>Redeemer</hi> be as effectual after the ſolemn <hi>reſignation</hi> of his mediation, as it was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> before ever actually he entred his Throne? <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Regnando id jam acquiſivit quod aeternum eſt, regnum ergo aeternum merito habere dici poteſt; quod attinet ad regnandi actum, Chriſtus regno ſeſe abdicatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus eſt, quod vero ad regnum attinet, regni ejus nullus erit finis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Whereas it is objected, why may not the <hi>Kingdom of the Mediator</hi> (actually) in glory be <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>government</hi> of God, as well as now the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> of God is <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Government</hi> of the
<hi>Mediator?</hi> To this I could anſwer, Our enquiry is not <hi>de re poſſibili vel impoſſibili,</hi> in the firſt place; but <hi>de re vera vel falſa.</hi> But Secondly, If we ſpeak of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> as God, it is true, and if I miſtake not, ſome <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators</hi> mean ſo, <hi>That as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170036:93"/> rules as well as the Son now, ſo then the Son ſhall rule as well as the Father; for though he ſurrender the Kingdom to the Father, yet ſo, as that God that is the Son alſo, with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, may be all in all.</hi> Thirdly, None dare ſay, That as God now rules by the Mediator, ſo then the Mediator ſhall rule by God; for the Mediator, as ſuch, is ſubordinate to God, and to ſay, the Mediator may rule as well as God, is the

                     </gap>. <hi>There is a neceſſity as to us, that God rule us by a Mediator in the Church Militant, but it is no way inconſiſtent either with the wiſdom or glory of God to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediately to the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt gives up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (not onely not as God, but) not
<hi>abſolutely</hi> conſidered as Mediator,<note place="margin">Chriſtus ut Deus nos cum illo ſubjectos habet, ſed ut Sacerdos nobiſcum illi ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectus eſt. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                     </note> for Chriſt even now as Mediator is ſubject to God really <hi>(For though Chriſt reigns, yet ſo ſtill, as that God reigns by Chriſt, though there be an immediate exerciſe of the Mediators Kingdom in the world, yet God keeps in the Eſſential Throne of his glory.)</hi> But then further, he ſhall be

By the ſurrender of the Kingdom therefore we cannot underſtand ſuch or ſuch an adminiſtration of the Kingdom, and not the Kingdom it ſelf; for all that Kingdom he receives, he ſurrenders.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170036:111"/> turn muſt inſtantly forget it, and they that receive it muſt conſtantly remember it;</hi> you have done the former; as for my ſelf, I will not deny but my memory hath long been <hi>aſleep,</hi> but I would now onely teſtifie (by this publique remembrance of my duty) that it is not <hi>dead.</hi> The Lord made you an inſtrument, though not of my <hi>natural,</hi> yet of my <hi>ſpiritual</hi> birth; you gave me not <hi>ſuck</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from the <hi>Breſt,</hi> but you <hi>fed</hi> me with the ſincere <hi>milk</hi> of the Word, you firſt taught me the <hi>firſt rudiments</hi> of Chriſtianity; not ſo much how to

<hi>phyſick,</hi> to expel it; you looked on <hi>Original ſin</hi> (as like a common fire in a Town) in my ſoul, and you ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, not ſo much how it <hi>came,</hi> as how to

How did you pray for me, when I was not able to pray for my ſelf? your heart was <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> when mine was
<hi>hard;</hi> my prayers now are to the Lord, that though I yet carry a body of ſin about me, and in my own ſenſe have been often a ſinking, that yet you would <hi>praiſe</hi> God with me, that a <hi>Nephew</hi> of ſo many prayers hath not <hi>periſhed</hi> indeed.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>condition</hi> now calls for my <hi>counſel,</hi> but I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:170036:114"/> of the Scriptures; that while ſome think it <hi>zeal</hi> to fall in
<hi>love</hi> with every fond opinion that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf on the <hi>Stage</hi> of the world, that you have <hi>choſen your Love, and love your choyce,</hi> in the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> mortification, and conformity unto God; That while others talk much of God, that your ſtudy is rather how to ſpeak with God himſelf, than of God to others; That while they love to gaze on the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of others onely, that you love rather to weep over your own ſins in your Cloſſet, than to cry out againſt the ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Market place: but herein you know you are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and I truſt you <hi>would much rejoyce that you had ſomething more you might account nothing for Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Go on, dear Aunt; <hi>Put on

<hi>Day will ere long break,</hi> and then farewel hardneſs of Heart, and temptations to Deſpaire, and mourning for Sin, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Love for ever.

                        <p>And <hi>Jacob</hi> was left alone, and there wreſtled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he ſaw that he prevailed not againſt him, he touched the hollow of his Thigh: And the hollow of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Thigh was out of joynt as he wreſtled with him. And he ſaid, Let me go for the day breaketh; and he ſaid I will not let thee go, unleſs thou bleſs me. And he ſaid unto him, What is thy name? and he ſaid, <hi>Jacob;</hi> and he ſaid, Thy name ſhall no more be called <hi>Jacob,</hi> but <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for as a Prince haſt thou power with God and with men, and haſt prevailed &amp;c.</p>

The words by ſome are rendred actively, and not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, <hi>He remained alone behind,</hi> not onely to ſee all his Houſhold and Stuff ſafe over the Foord, but alſo to retire to Prayer.

<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> had the better of the <hi>Angel;</hi> poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it began at <hi>midnight.</hi> It is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how far a man <hi>runs,</hi> if he come not nigh the Garland, nor how long the Soul <hi>wreſtles</hi> with God ſo much, if he wants Faith to get the <hi>victory.</hi> The
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> ſeems not to <hi>wreſtle</hi> fairly, he ſhould have given, and he takes
<hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> of <hi>Jacob.</hi> For an <hi>Angel</hi> to fight with a <hi>man,</hi> with a
<hi>ſingle</hi> man, with a <hi>travelling</hi> and <hi>tired</hi> man, was too much:
<hi>Jacob</hi> was rather fit to <hi>flie</hi> than to <hi>fight;</hi> nay, rather fit to
<hi>ſleep</hi> than either to <hi>fight</hi> or <hi>fly. The night was made for man to reſt in, but when we cannot ſleep; Oh that we might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our waking in wreſtling (as</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
<hi>did) with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have the <hi>Duel</hi> it ſelf; wherein we have the <hi>ground</hi> of the Quarrel, and the <hi>manner</hi> of the Fight.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The ground of the Quarrel; Jacob</hi> was afraid of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and he would have a Bleſſing; he flies <hi>to</hi> God, that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170036:119"/> he might not fly <hi>from</hi> Man. Go would have left off, but
<hi>Jacob</hi> would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods conſent to bleſs him; it ſeems that <hi>Jacob</hi> now was on the <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,</hi> and God on the <hi>defenſive</hi> ſide; Lord ſays
<hi>Jacob,</hi> thou art my <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and before thou art <hi>releaſed, bleſs me. God is taken captive by Prayer, and become a priſoner to man, and ſtands at his courteſie, who ſays, I will not let thee go, unleſs thou bleſs me.</hi> We ſay, thoſe that have the
<hi>longeſt Sword,</hi> may command <hi>Peace</hi> when they will; <hi>Jacob</hi> here is reſolved to make his own terms, for he hath the <hi>vantage</hi>-ground of the <hi>Angel,</hi> he hath the <hi>Angel</hi> at his mercy. <hi>I will not let thee go unleſs thou bleſs me. It is not belike now, as God will, but as man will;</hi> Jacob <hi>prays to God, and then God prays to</hi> Jacob, <hi>or rather prays</hi> Jacob. <hi>Let man be a Suter to God, and God will be a Suter to man.</hi> The Saints are Gods Favorites, and they may have any thing of him. It is a greater trouble ſometimes to God, not to be asked, than to give <hi>(Moleſtius eſt Deo nihil peti, quam dare.)</hi> Oh the power of Prayer</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pray not for this people,</hi> ſays God
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170036:119"/> as if God were afraid of <hi>Prayer. The Prayer of Gods</hi> Jacobs <hi>are of ſuch power, that God is fain and forced to forbid them to pray, becauſe he would not grant, leſt he ſhould be overcome:</hi> This Chriſt ſheweth, when he reſembles his
<hi>Father</hi> to the <hi>deaf Judge,</hi> and his <hi>Petitioner</hi> to the impotent woman, which cryed to him, and made him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to her, as if ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

How mighty with the Almighty?</hi> Let Prayer be onely mighty with God; it is enough that Prayer is as it were Almighty with man.</p>

                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:170036:120"/>Secondly, We have the nature or <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Combate,</hi> It was both corporeal and ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It was outward or <hi>corporeal. Jacob</hi> was real <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> and the <hi>Angel</hi> appeared in the form of <hi>fleſh and blood.</hi> This <hi>wreſtling</hi> was not ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al onely, becauſe of what the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We
<hi>wreſtle</hi> not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers; neither ſecondly, was it in a <hi>dream,</hi> as the <hi>Rabby dreams,</hi> as if <hi>Jacobs</hi> Thigh had been hurt, not by <hi>wreſtling</hi> but by <hi>travelling;</hi> But the continuance of
<hi>Jacobs wreſtling</hi> till the morning, the real and ſenſible hurt of his <hi>Thigh,</hi> the impoſition of a <hi>new name,</hi> the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi>
12.4. ſhew that his <hi>wreſtling</hi> was real. The <hi>Angel</hi> would <hi>try a fall</hi> with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and Jacob, <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> would try <hi>a fall</hi> with the

                     <hi>ſpiritual; Jacob</hi> contended as well by the ſtrength of his

And laſtly, <hi>Jacob</hi> had this ſenſible hurt, and viſible
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170036:128"/> lameneſs, that hereafter he might know,<note place="margin">Claudus in viâ melior eſt quam currens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra viam.</note> and others underſtand from him that he did not <hi>wreſtle in a dream,</hi> or dream of a wreſtling with an Angel; He beheld the teſtimonies of a divine Power about him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every</hi> Jacob <hi>hath his halting, but there are ſome that halt that are not</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs. <hi>How long will you halt between two Opinions?</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. Where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is the Chriſtian, of whom it may be ſaid as once it was of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold an
<hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed in whom is no guile? <hi>The</hi> Habaſſines <hi>are</hi> Jacobites
<hi>and Chriſtians from the girdle upward, and</hi> Jews <hi>downward; admitting both of Baptiſm and Circumciſion:</hi> So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny divide their love between Chriſt and the world; look on their heads and they are all of <hi>gold,</hi> they have golden profeſſions, but look on their feet, and they are of clay, they have worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Some fancy, as if <hi>Jacob</hi> were cured of this <hi>halting</hi> the next day; but it is beleeved he kept his <hi>halting</hi> as long as he kept (on earth) his <hi>bleſſing,</hi> and went not onely <hi>Iſrael, but halting</hi> or <hi>limping</hi> to the grave. <hi>Jacob halted,</hi> and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170036:129"/> yet was <hi>bleſſed;</hi> his <hi>bleſſing</hi> did neither take away his <hi>halting,</hi> nor his <hi>halting</hi> did not remove his <hi>bleſſing. How many halt with</hi> Jacob, <hi>that are not bleſſed with</hi> Jacob? which made an Antient cry out,
<hi>Oh that I might halt with</hi> Jacob, <hi>and that God would put the hollow of my Thigh out of joynt, that I might be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that my ſinew of pride might ſhrink, that I might with</hi> Jacob <hi>prevail with God. Jacob</hi> halted, and yet the Jews ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored him with a daily remembrance. Neither the blindneſs of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> nor lameneſs of
<hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> nor the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Jacob,</hi> made them leſs beloved of God, nor leſs noble in the eyes of wiſe and good men. Such <hi>Infirmities</hi> and
<hi>deformities,</hi> that are not contracted by our wilfull wickedneſs, but caſt on us by
<hi>Providence,</hi> are matter not of <hi>ſcorn</hi> but of <hi>thanks</hi> to thoſe that have them not, and matter not of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair</hi> but of <hi>humility</hi> to thoſe that have them.
<hi>The wound of</hi> Jacob <hi>is not ſo grievous, as the ſign is comfortable: Well is that part of us loſt, which may give aſſurance of the ſalvation of the whole; and our Faith is not yet ſound,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170036:129"/> if it hath not taught us to neglect pain for God; and more to love the ſeal of his preſence than our fleſh.</hi> It is yet remembred who had the ſenſe of the following Diſtincts.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Stigmata</hi> maxillis bajulans inſignia laudis</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding <hi>Jacob halts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſtus pendebat &amp; tamen petebat, hic Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus laxatus eſt &amp; tamen luctatus eſt</note> yet he <hi>wreſtles.</hi> In that <hi>Jacob</hi> halted, it was a ſign of Gods preſence, in that though hee
<hi>halted,</hi> yet hee <hi>wreſtled,</hi> it was a ſign of Gods <hi>approbation, Jacob wreſtles though he halts. Valorous</hi> Jacob!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He wins the <hi>Victory</hi> in concluſion over the <hi>Angel,</hi> though he
<hi>halt:</hi> And that two ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Jacob</hi> prevails <hi>Polemically,</hi> or (as I may ſay) by Power, <hi>As a Prince he had power over the Angel,</hi> Gen. 32.28. Hoſ. 12.3. O Lord! How few <hi>Jacobs</hi> are there in the world? Either we <hi>wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> not at all, or we get not the <hi>victory. Jacob</hi> prevailed with God, thats a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indeed; for it had been nothing for
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170036:130"/> God to have prevailed with <hi>Jacob;</hi> yet I dare ſay, it is a hard thing for God to prevail over <hi>man,</hi> as it is for man to prevail with God; and the reaſon is plain, becauſe even when God prevails with man, man prevails with God; when man
<hi>yeelds</hi> to God, then God <hi>yeelds</hi> to man. But doth <hi>Jacob</hi> indeed prevail with God? O the <hi>Princedom</hi> of Prayer! None ſo ſtrong as the <hi>Lyon of</hi> Judah, for he overcame the <hi>roaring Lyon;</hi> yet a beleeving <hi>Tongue,</hi> an humble <hi>Knee,</hi> and a broken <hi>Heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers</hi> even <hi>our Conqueror. Prayer is omnipotent, for as ſin is called infinite</hi> (objectively not formally) <hi>becauſe it is practiſed againſt an infinite God; ſo Prayer is as it were Omnipotent, becauſe it prevails with an Omnipotent God. When God ſaw that he prevailed not; When he ſaw;</hi> God knew the iſſue of the
<hi>Combate</hi> before he took the Field; this is ſpoken, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or to our capacity; the experience of the thing is taken for Gods <hi>fore-knowledge;</hi> the Lord with the blaſt of his mouth could have confounded <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Lord could not, becauſe he would not; <hi>Gods cannot
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170036:130"/> in Scripture, is his will not.</hi> He diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of his <hi>Power</hi> according to his own <hi>will</hi> and <hi>purpoſe;</hi> and therefore as long as he can <hi>do all</hi> he will, he is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>The object of the Omnipotency of God, is whatſoever is adverſe to his Nature, and doth not imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and therefore it is no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Power of God not to be able to ſin, ſin being rather a defect than an act, rather a ſign of Impotency than Power.</hi> We ſay often concerning thoſe things wee will not doe, wee cannot do; eſpecially, when though we have <hi>Power</hi> to do thoſe things, yet we have <hi>determined</hi> the contrary; which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is more conſiderable with God than with man, becauſe the <hi>decrees</hi> of man are changeable, and may be <hi>broken off,</hi> but the divine <hi>Decrees</hi> are <hi>immutable,</hi> and unalterable; and therefore when it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt could not do many mighty works becauſe of unbeleef</hi> in his own Country,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.58. the meaning is, Chriſt would not, in reſpect of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef, not becauſe abſolutely he could not; and that the <hi>Angel could do nothing till</hi> Lot <hi>came to</hi> Zoar, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22. it was not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170036:131"/> in reſpect of <hi>Lots Power,</hi> as of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels pitty.</hi> So here, God would give <hi>Jacob</hi> the victory. <hi>Even as lovers are diſpoſed for the nonce to take a fall one of another, the ſtronger of the weaker, ſo God ſhall wreſtle a fall with thee, O Chriſtian, as he did with</hi> Jacob, <hi>and yeeld ſo much in love to thee, as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee to give him the foil and fall, and to prevail againſt him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deus qui contra ſe viribus nullis ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vincitur</note> The Lord fell down before <hi>Jacob, Jacob</hi> did not throw him down; God was as willing to be
<hi>conquered,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> for all his <hi>heart</hi> was willing to <hi>conquer. Jacob</hi> prevails over God before he prevails over man.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Let <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> recal what they expreſs,</l>
                     <l>Before you do the greater do the leſs.</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Jacob prevailed,</hi> When? not before but after he was lame; as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſo might <hi>Jacob</hi> ſay, <hi>when I am weak then am I ſtrong:</hi> It is a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170036:131"/> true experience in the wreſtling School of Chriſt, <hi>when a man is ſtrongeſt he is weakeſt, and when he is weakeſt he is ſtrongeſt; Jacob</hi> here made the <hi>Angel</hi> fall when he was ſcarce able to ſtand, and <hi>ſtood</hi> it out; though his <hi>Joynts were out of joynt, yet ſtill he wreſtles, and the more lame he was, the more reaſon he had to hold. Oh happy loſs of</hi> Jacob! <hi>he loſt a joynt, and wone a Bleſſing; he was bleſſed becauſe he would rather halt than leave ere he was bleſſed.</hi> You ſee prayer can do more than all the Witches in the world, they can onely bridle the <hi>Devil,</hi> but this bridles or bindes <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Jacob</hi> prevails <hi>politically;</hi> as well as powerfully; he treats with the <hi>Angel,</hi> and proffers to give him fair <hi>quarter;</hi> Articles and Propoſitions paſs between them; <hi>Let me go,</hi> who crys ſo? <hi>Jacob</hi> or the <hi>Angel?</hi> the Angel; which the Lord ſo ſpeaketh, not as though he could not have <hi>departed</hi> without
<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> leave, but ſheweth therein how much he eſteemed of his Servant, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſo much to his <hi>Prayers,</hi> as though they had bound him. <hi>Prayer</hi> is the
<hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:170036:132"/> of God; and, be it ſpoken with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, God is ſometimes at the
<hi>ſervice</hi> of prayer, <hi>command ye me concerning the works of my hands;</hi> as if the Lord ſhould ſay, <hi>Prayer,</hi> I am your Servant, <hi>the prayer of the righteous avails much with God, if it be fervent,</hi> it holds Chriſt in the Galleries, and the Angel on the ground, and will not let go without a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. <hi>As he that is a beleever hath all becauſe he hath God that is all; ſo he that is a</hi> Jacob <hi>can do all things, in a ſenſe, becauſe he hath conquered him that can do all things, I, and him that is all things. Ligatum habent ſancti Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ut non puniat niſi permiſerint ipſi,</hi> Exo. 32.10. No Grace hath done ſo much as Prayer, for all Graces have had their power from Prayer in Chriſt, wherefore prayer hath done as many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits as all the Graces beſides.</p>
                  <p>And that which is more than all this, if more can be, Prayer <hi>overcomes God, not onely when he is well pleaſed, as he was with</hi> Jacob, <hi>when any child may deal with him, but alſo when he was diſpleaſed, as he was with the</hi> Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, <hi>when no man could come near
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170036:132"/> him, when his wrath burned as fire,</hi> when he thundered from Heaven and clove the rocks aſunder, when the Sea and Land was put into a trembling and ſhaking, <hi>yet when</hi> Moſes <hi>entred into the gap, all this Omnipotent Power came to nothing, God, though never ſo angry, was not able to enter on the breach,</hi> but prayer got the victory over him,
<hi>Let me alone,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Moſes, Exo.</hi> 32.10. <hi>that I may conſume this Nation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Flectitur iratus voce rogante De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> 
                     <hi>and I will make of thee a mighty people;</hi> God ſeems to hire <hi>Moſes</hi> to be ſilent, as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Moſes,</hi> leave off thy praying (as the Chaldee hath it) though
<hi>Iſrael</hi> periſh, yet thou ſhalt proſper, thou ſhalt not be a loſer by it,
<hi>Ile make of thee a mighty people.</hi> Let <hi>me alone!</hi> who would look for ſuch a word from God to man? Let <hi>me alone!</hi> As yet <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid nothing; <hi>before he opens his mouth, God prevents his importunity, as foreſeeing that holy violence that the requeſt of</hi> Moſes <hi>would have offered to him.</hi> Moſes ſtood trembling before the Majeſty of his Maker, and yet hears him ſay, <hi>Let me alone.</hi> The Mercy of God, hath, as
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170036:133"/> it were, obliged his Power to the Faith of man, and by <hi>Praye:</hi> the hands of the Almighty are <hi>bound to the Peace,</hi> when he hath a <hi>quarrel</hi> with his people; the <hi>Servants prayers</hi> hinder the <hi>Lords power,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Servi preces Domini po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediebant.</note> as one ſweetly.

                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Prayer's like a vapor fum'd from th'earth, that flies</l>

                     <l>It falls in Thunder-bolts, at leaſt in thunder.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Saints! conſider the power of Prayer, God forbad <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray, and yet he obtained what he prayed for, and diverted him from thoſe Judgements he threatned; <hi>If</hi> Moſes
<hi>prevailed againſt a command, how cannot we but prevail when we
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170036:133"/> have a promiſe? if</hi> Moſes <hi>prevailed when God bade him not to pray, we ſhall certainly prevail, when God bids us to pray.</hi> Ask and ye ſhall have; it is but ask and have.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let me go,</hi> ſays God here to <hi>Jacob,</hi> one would think that ſhould rather be the ſpeech of <hi>Jacob</hi> to God. <hi>Let me go!</hi> is the Angel in earneſt? ſurely, the
<hi>Angel</hi> was as willing to <hi>bleſs</hi> as he was to <hi>combate</hi> with
<hi>Jacob;</hi> though God did not directly bid him ſtrive, yet he ſecretly inſinuated, that if he would hold faſt he ſhould have the <hi>bleſſing;</hi> Like as a <hi>Father</hi> being angry, makes as if he would go from his <hi>Son,</hi> and ſaith to one,<note place="margin">Quid eſt ſervo dicere dimitte me niſi depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum prabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</note>

                  <p>Let me go, <hi>for the day breaks;</hi> not as though the Angel was to go to the reſt of the bleſſed company of <hi>Angels</hi> to ſing their <hi>morning Hymne</hi> to God, as the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> imagine, for they, not onely in the morning, but, conſtantly praiſe God; this is ſpoken according to the manner or cuſtom of men, having now taken the form and ſhape of a man, as though he had haſte to other buſineſs, and leaving <hi>Jacob</hi> to his affairs; as alſo, becauſe the <hi>Angel</hi> would not have this <hi>viſion</hi> deſcried
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170036:134"/> and diſcerned by others, ſeeing it ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was intended for a private <hi>conflict</hi> in the night, without <hi>ſpectators,</hi> none muſt be witneſſes of it but <hi>Jacob,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf know fully with whom he
<hi>wreſtled;</hi> and that <hi>Jacob</hi> might not be too curious in <hi>gazing</hi> on that
<hi>ſhape,</hi> wherein the Angel appeared. Laſtly, Some apprehend the <hi>Angel</hi> to ſpeak like a greater grave man, as if he had done ſomething below his honor, as to contend with his child, and did not care to have it known to the reſt of the ſervants, <hi>as if the Angel had been aſhamed, and being foiled by his inferior, ſhould have ſaid, be gone, never let man ſee that thou haſt conquered God, the day breaks, and will diſcover it.</hi> The Hebrews bring <hi>Jacob</hi> in their tradition, as ſtrictly examining the <hi>Angel,</hi> as ſuſpecting that he with whom he <hi>wreſtled</hi> had been a Night-walker, and had intended either to have <hi>robbed</hi> or murdered him.

                  <p>There are two circumſtances more in this ſtory.

<hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw the <hi>eſſence</hi> of God, for that is <hi>inviſible,</hi> but he ſaw him more <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> than ever he did before. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw God <hi>face to face, Moſes</hi> ſpake with God <hi>mouth to mouth;</hi> that is, they ſaw and
<hi>ſpoke</hi> with God as one <hi>friend</hi> to another. As before, when <hi>Jacob</hi> had the
<hi>Viſion of the Ladder,</hi> he called, out of thankfulneſs, the place <hi>Bethel;</hi> ſo
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170036:141"/> now, he calleth this place <hi>Peniel,</hi> that his poſterity by that name might call to <hi>remembrance</hi> this heavenly <hi>Viſion</hi> in that place ſhewed to their Father <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> Where-ever the Saints prevail with God, there is <hi>Peniel:</hi> Sometimes they may call the Congregation <hi>Peniel,</hi> there they hear the voyce of God; their Cloſets <hi>Peniel,</hi> there they ſee the face of God. Oh how comfortable is it to
<hi>reflect</hi> on the times and <hi>places</hi> of Gods <hi>appearances to his people!</hi> For
<hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> to look back on the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>There we were Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to look back on <hi>Ai,</hi> and to ſay, there was
<hi>Peniel.</hi> How ſweet to conſider, there was the <hi>place</hi> where God ſoftened my
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> there was the <hi>Bethel</hi> where God revealed his love to me!</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Circumſtance, is, the obſervation of the <hi>Jews, They eat not of the ſinew that ſhrunk, which is upon the hollow of the Thigh;</hi> which cuſtom was not taken up out of any <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,</hi> which that ſimple age was given to, but of a <hi>reverent remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of this <hi>Providence,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell

                  <p>But may ſome doubting Chriſtians ſay, what is all this to us?

                  </p>
                  <p>Where is the ſpirit of prayer? gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we had rather <hi>ſleep</hi> than

<hi>O that this were wreſtling or praying with God, and gaining the bleſſing!

The Spirit of God helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, even as the Nurſe helpeth the child, holding it by the ſleeve,<note place="margin">Quomodo non exaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Spiritus à Patre cum exaudit cum Patre?</note> or as the Staff upholds an old man that elſe cannot ſtand; or as the Father ſeeing the child <hi>lifting</hi> at a great <hi>weight</hi> too heavy for him, runs to aſſiſt him, claſping hands about the burthen with him. We have no ſtrength

<hi>dying,</hi> and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer by <hi>yeelding.</hi> Prayer prevails with God, not as it is our act, but as it is the Lords inſtitution. God looks on Prayer, as his image, he knows his children by their <hi>crying,</hi> and when they cry he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently runs to help them. As Q. <hi>E.</hi> gave Sir <hi>W.

                  <p>It is true, <hi>Jacob</hi> prevailed over God, but it was with God. That God that called
<hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>fight,</hi> gave him wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to <hi>foil</hi> himſelf. <hi>He that fought againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>fought alſo in</hi> Jacob; <hi>it was not</hi> Jacob <hi>prevailed over the Angel, but the Angel in</hi> Jacob <hi>that prevailed over the Angel; he fought not againſt God without God; he that provoked him to</hi> fight <hi>inſtructed him how to</hi> reſiſt,
<hi>at the ſame time both contending againſt him, and for him,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170036:146"/> as being both Opponent and Defendant, aſſaulting him with the one hand, and aſſiſting him with the other; ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with more ſtrength in reſiſting, than expreſſing ſtrength in oppoſing him;</hi> how ſweet to conſider! The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel contends with <hi>Jacob</hi> with his left hand, and contends for <hi>Jacob</hi> with his right hand, otherwiſe who dares enter the <hi>Liſts</hi> with the Almighty? by whoſe breath man is

<hi>conquered,</hi> by this he overcame. If the Angel that ſtrove with him, had not ſtrove for him, he had been ſo far from gaining the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he had loſt the name of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Wherefore, beleevers, fall to wreſtling, but if you meaſure your

<hi>Adverſary,</hi> but the <hi>mouth</hi> of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170036:146"/> that God that hath promiſed and can perform. The <hi>Match</hi> is too unequal with the Devil, much more with God; We are like <hi>Graſs-hoppers</hi> to thoſe
<hi>Gyants,</hi> when we compare our ſelves with them, how can we but deſpair? but when we compare our ſelves with God, how can we deſpair? He that brings <hi>Jacob</hi> into the
<hi>field</hi> gives him the <hi>victory.</hi> The example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> contending with the Lord in prayer, is notable alſo, and ſhews what a friend at Court prayer is, when otherwiſe man dare not look the Lord in the face. Prayer is the Aſylum, the laſt refuge we have to fly to,<note place="margin">Deus qui certamini praeerat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res etiam ad vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat. <hi>De la Hay in loc.</hi>
                     </note> and if Juſtice beat us out of that Hold, we are conquered.

                  <p>There are Four <hi>Duels</hi> that every <hi>Jacob</hi> is to fight in the world, beſides that wherein he contends with God, and unleſs he be firſt a Prevailer with God, he cannot be a
<hi>Conqueror</hi> in the reſt. There is an <hi>inferior Duel,</hi> with man,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170036:147"/> not ſo much with <hi>ſinful man,</hi> as with the <hi>Man of Sin;</hi> an <hi>exterior Duel</hi> with the World, an <hi>interior Duel</hi> with the Fleſh, a
<hi>ſuperior Duel</hi> with the Devil; but if we are <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if God have
<hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated us,</hi> what can man do againſt us? If God have <hi>called</hi> us, what can the <hi>World</hi> do againſt us? If God hath <hi>juſtified</hi> us, what can the
<hi>Fleſh</hi> do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us? If the Lord will <hi>glorifie</hi> us, what can the
<hi>Devil</hi> do againſt us?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a <hi>Duel between the Fleſh and the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>old man</hi> and the <hi>new man.</hi> And here bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſtrength of the God of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Liſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, <hi>&amp;c. The fleſh luſteth againſt the spirit, and the spirit luſteth againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other, ſo that yee cannot do the things which ye would.</hi> Here we have firſt a <hi>Duel</hi> or Combate between the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the
<hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>mind,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>members;</hi> the
<hi>Fleſh</hi> and its members luſt againſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the mind, the
<hi>Spirit</hi> and the mind luſt againſt the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and its members.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170036:147"/> The Fleſh and the Spirit are preſented as the two great
<hi>Houſes,</hi> the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Generals</hi> of the world that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate one againſt another. The <hi>fleſh takes the field,</hi> and under its conduct <hi>march</hi> its
<hi>works,</hi> as ſo many Souldiers; <hi>Adultery, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> lead up the Van; <hi>Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Envyings,</hi> make the main Body; <hi>Murders, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, &amp;c.</hi> bring up the Rear; All theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive pay of the Fleſh, and obſerve its
<hi>command.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and his Fruits or <hi>Followers</hi> are, <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Temperance,</hi> all theſe are ſworn Souldiers to, and manifeſtly wear the <hi>Colours</hi> of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here is the <hi>Field,</hi> or the perſon or <hi>ſubject</hi> where this
<hi>Duel</hi> is fought, in the ſouls of Gods <hi>Jacobs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the regenerate &amp; unregenrate part of man: Not that the Fleſh fights in one part of the Soul, and the Spirit in the other, as if the Fleſh did challenge the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170036:148"/> 
                     <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contraria poſſunt eſſe fimulin eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto.</note> and the Spirit did challenge onely the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> but they are mingled and combined together in all the <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the Soul. The <hi>intellectual</hi> part or mind is not one part fleſh, and another part ſpirit, but the whole mind is <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the whole mind is <hi>spirit,</hi> that is, the fleſh and ſpirit are in the <hi>whole mind,</hi> partly one, and partly the other. The <hi>whole Will,</hi> is partly fleſh, and partly ſpirit, they are not diſtinguiſhed in <hi>place,</hi> but onely ſevered in <hi>apprehenſion.</hi> As in the dawning of the day, the <hi>Air</hi> is not wholly <hi>light,</hi> or wholly <hi>dark,</hi> neither in one part of it is it light, and in another part dark, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Air is
<hi>partly dark</hi> and <hi>partly light.</hi> As in a Veſſel of <hi>luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm water,</hi> the water it ſelf is not only <hi>hot,</hi> or onely <hi>cold,</hi> or in one <hi>part hot,</hi> and in another <hi>part cold,</hi> but <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> are mixt together in every quantity of the <hi>water.</hi> So here this <hi>Duel</hi> is not at a diſtance, but it is an intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in the ſame Soul; like the <hi>ſtruggling</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Eſau</hi> in the ſame <hi>womb,</hi> there is no room to hold an
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170036:148"/>

A mans <hi>enemies</hi> here, too truly, are they of his own houſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Here is the <hi>Manner of the Duel</hi> or Combate, they fight and conflict one with another, even as <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> or the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſraelite;</hi> the <hi>fleſh</hi> luſteth againſt the <hi>spirit,</hi> and the
<hi>spirit</hi> luſteth againſt the <hi>fleſh, the good that I would, I do not, but the evill which I would not, that I do.</hi> Here <hi>Knowledge</hi> fights
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170036:149"/> againſt <hi>Ignorance, Faith</hi> againſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef, Heavenly-mindedneſs</hi> againſt <hi>Worldly-mindedneſs;</hi> as <hi>light</hi> againſt

It is true, there is a <hi>Duel</hi> or Conflict in a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170036:149"/> natural man, but not between the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>spirit,</hi> for they are all <hi>fleſh</hi> and no <hi>spirit;</hi> not between the <hi>old</hi> and
<hi>new</hi> man, for they are wholly of the <hi>old,</hi> and have nothing of the <hi>new man</hi> in them; that conflict is not from the mind <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,</hi> but onely from the mind
<hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened;</hi> not ariſing from the love of the <hi>command,</hi> but onely from the
<hi>fear</hi> of the <hi>threatning:</hi> That conteſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Conſcience</hi> and the <hi>Heart,</hi> between the <hi>Judgement</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> only; not between
<hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Love</hi> and <hi>Love, Joy</hi> and <hi>Joy, Fear</hi> and
<hi>Fear,</hi> as in the regenerate. The voyce of <hi>Herods</hi> conflict was this, The Law ſaith, I muſt not commit <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt,</hi> I, ſaith his Conſcience, if you do ſo, you are condemned, but ſaith Luſt, <hi>Herodias</hi> pleaſeth me, and I will <hi>enjoy</hi> her; here is the <hi>Conſcience</hi> only againſt the heart, but the voyce of <hi>Davids</hi> conflict was otherwiſe. <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſaith, <hi>David,</hi> you muſt not commit
<hi>Adultery,</hi> youle ſin againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> and againſt your <hi>light; Luſt</hi> ſuggeſteth the ſweetneſs of that ſin, and likewiſe his <hi>Love</hi> to God, ſaith, I dare not <hi>wholly</hi>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:170036:150"/> give my <hi>conſent</hi> to this Adultery; here is not onely
<hi>Conſcience</hi> againſt <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but <hi>Affection</hi> againſt
<hi>Affection;</hi> in a word, In a natural man there is a <hi>fight</hi> in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> but no <hi>fight</hi> againſt the <hi>fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Ground of the Duel. Theſe two are contrary,</hi> there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>Laws</hi> by which they <hi>Govern,</hi> the Fleſh draws one way, the Spirit draws another; here is no <hi>reconciliation</hi> of differences, or taking up the quarrel by
<hi>Arbitration;</hi> the Fleſh gives no <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to the Spirit, nor the Spirit to the Fleſh; the <hi>Quarrel</hi> is to laſt till Death puls down the Stage, either <hi>kill or be killed. No man can ſerve theſe two Maſters, the Fleſh and the Spirit; he that hath ſerved the Fleſh, may liſt himſelf under, and ſerve the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but at the ſame time no man can war for the Fleſh and for the Spirit;</hi> theſe are two contrary Principles, two contrary States, and they can never <hi>match</hi> together, though they always <hi>meet</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the <hi>regenerate.

                     <hi>The puſh of</hi> Moſes <hi>prayers did more than all the Pikes of</hi> Iſrael. Prayer is <hi>Sions Orator</hi> and Ambaſſador to plead and prevail with God.

When the wheels of <hi>Providence</hi> ſtand ſtill <hi>(q. d.)</hi> prayer <hi>oyles</hi> them, and puts them into <hi>motion.</hi> It engaged God to divide the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and to break open the priſon doors for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul. (Oratio hominis eſt res omnipotentiſſima,</hi> Luth. Hyperb. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio eſt telum quo vulneratur cor Dei.</hi> Ambr. in Cant.) Prayer, like the wind getting into the bowels of the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170036:160"/> earth, will make <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> in the Territories of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and like a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneer</hi> undermine and <hi>blow up</hi> all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and <hi>Babels</hi> in the world. <hi>Prayer will make all the Devils in Hell, and enemies to</hi> Sion <hi>on earth, to ſtrike ſail, for it hath</hi> q. d. <hi>Omnipotency it ſelf under its lee. (Edeſia totum mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſanguine &amp; oratione convertit.</hi> Luther.) It were better to have all the Spears, Bows, and Ordnance in the world againſt us, than to have an Army of Prayers, or to have prayer in arms againſt us. <hi>Armes,</hi> and <hi>Armies,</hi> and <hi>Armor,</hi> cannot pull down <hi>Antichriſt</hi> without <hi>Faith and Prayer,</hi>

                     </note> but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prayer can pull down Antichriſt without them. <hi>Generals</hi> cannot fight with lame and <hi>ſick Souldiers,</hi> but the prayers of lame, ſick men, have done more in war for the <hi>intereſt</hi> of Chriſt, than an <hi>Hoſt</hi> of an Hundred thouſand men. Saints, fear not to loſe the day, when Chriſt ſhall take the field! <hi>While</hi> Moſes <hi>held up his hand,</hi> Iſrael
<hi>prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; While</hi> Sion <hi>cannot lift up a Spear againſt</hi> Amalek, <hi>yet it is ſufficient if they can but lift up their hand, the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170036:160"/> victory is theirs.</hi> Prayer can put a ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and <hi>tottering</hi> on the Kings Courts, <hi>Prelats, Pilates of Babylon,</hi> and, like <hi>white Gunpowder,</hi> can deſtroy <hi>Babylon</hi> and make no noyſe. Prayer can <hi>yoak</hi> all the Swords in
<hi>Europe</hi> againſt the <hi>Scarlet whore</hi> and her Paramors; and though ſhe hitherto hath been <hi>grinding the faces</hi> of <hi>Sion;</hi> yet to bring <hi>Grice q. d.</hi> to the Lords <hi>Mill,</hi> the pooreſt <hi>Boy</hi> or <hi>Girle,</hi> if he be but a
<hi>Jacobine,</hi> can do more to <hi>lift the King of Saints</hi> into the Throne, than all the Powers and <hi>Potentates</hi> on this ſide Eternity can do to <hi>keep him out</hi> of his Throne. Prayer cannot be conquered, untill Chriſt with whom it is <hi>potent</hi> and
<hi>great</hi> be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Prayer ſets Chriſt in the <hi>front</hi> of the Battel againſt
<hi>Hell,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Devil, beat Chriſt, and you beat me,</hi> take <hi>Omnipotency captive,</hi> and I am your <hi>Priſoner.</hi> Prayer haſtens the <hi>nuptials</hi> of the
<hi>Bride</hi> to the <hi>Lamb;</hi> and though now <hi>Hypocriſie, Unbeleef, &amp;c. forbid the Banes,</hi> yet the <hi>Match</hi> goes on, and they cannot hinder the <hi>Marriage. Our Father,</hi> and <hi>thy Kingdom come,</hi> are the ſtrongeſt weapons in the world, they thunder and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170036:161"/> lighten in Satans Regions, and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cannot but both hear their report and <hi>feel</hi> their power.

<hi>repaired. Prayer, though it made not the world, yet it ſhall unmake it, and ſet up a new Heaven and a new Earth.</hi> A Saint may not fear the Devil though he meet him in the dark, if he be armed with Faith and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that hath God on his ſide need not care whom he meets in the face.</hi> Prayer is

<hi>Lord let my will be done, and mine, becauſe thine.</hi> We often <hi>ask,</hi> and
<hi>miſs,</hi> becauſe we <hi>ask amiſs. Your Father oft gives that in anger, which he would deny to give if he were pleaſed.</hi> Its better to be without <hi>Quails,</hi> than to
<hi>ſurfet,</hi> to have either a long <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,</hi> or rather a full <hi>denial,</hi> than an anſwer in <hi>wrath. The contradictions by God put to the prayers of the Saints in this age, is one of the greateſt wonders of the age.</hi> Our hearts are oft (as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſaith) like <hi>crooked, Bows,</hi> and no wonder the Arrows we ſhoot are loſt, when many times we never aim at
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170036:178"/> the <hi>mark.</hi> We muſt take heed of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>backward</hi> with
<hi>Jonah,</hi> who, rather than he would be accompted a <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> cared not ſo much for the <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Nineveh,</hi> as for his own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Says he, <hi>was not this my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> one would have thought that the <hi>ſalt Sea</hi> ſhould have waſhed away thoſe <hi>briny humours.</hi> Take heed of the <hi>heady prayers</hi> of the
<hi>Diſciples, Cauſe fire to come down from Heaven</hi> (q.d.) theſe are Rebels to thy intereſt, we have preached the word of Life to them, and they ſcoff at, and ſcorn us for our labors; ſurely, O Lord! if they were thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected they would have beleeved ere now; they have ſinned againſt their own <hi>light,</hi> and againſt the revelation of thy <hi>love,</hi> they are finally impenitent; Lord conſume them; But theſe were <hi>hot</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Chriſt <hi>cools</hi> them, <hi>You know not of what ſpirits you are of;</hi> Joh. 15.7. you have not the <hi>perſons,</hi> and therefore it is not convenient you ſhould have the
<hi>prayers</hi> of <hi>Elias. Every one that rides in a fiery Chariot, is not an</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.
<hi>(Non petitur in nomine ſalvatoris quicquid petitur contra rationem ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis.</hi>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:170036:179"/> Laſtly, Let us beware of <hi>ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> prayers, not to write after that copy, <hi>Lord, when thou commeſt into thy Kingdom, let one of my Sons fit on thy right hand another on thy left.</hi> At the left hand of Chriſt! Surely ſhe did not know for what ſhe prayed, for none but Goats ſhall ſtand at Chriſts left hand. The rule of our prayers is not what <hi>pleaſeth</hi> our <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> but what is correſpondent to, and <hi>agreeable</hi> with the <hi>Revealed Word.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. <hi>Plato</hi> III. <hi>de legibus</hi> p. 811.) That which is glorious in the eyes of a man, nay, of a good man, is often abominable in the eyes of God. <hi>Pray for nothing but what God hath promiſed, if ever you would have God to perform what you pray for. It is better to beleeve that the will of God ſhall be fulfilled,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deus non dando, dat nobis, &amp; nos non ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiendo, à Deo accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> 
                     <hi>than to behold our own wills fulfilled.</hi> The Saints in this age juſtly condemn the former Generation, <hi>for doing that which was never commanded;</hi> and I beleeve the next Generation will as juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn the Saints in this age, for
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170036:179"/> 
                     <hi>beleeving ſome things which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver promiſed.</hi> The
<hi>Interceſſion</hi> of our Lord Jeſus is a <hi>cenſer of gold,</hi> and can we deſire him to offer up our <hi>droſſie</hi> prayers for <hi>Incenſe?</hi> they are often
<hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> in our ſight, and how can they be ſweet in his Fathers <hi>noſtrils? Many of Sions Petitions are now in the Lords accompt but waſte paper, and at the last day ſhall never be ſeen hung on the file in Heaven; and indeed how can they speed? when (our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences bearing witneſs) they are neither worded by the Scriptures, indited by the Spirit, nor ſubſcribed by a blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heart. (Eo modo ſunt omnia pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenda quo modo ſunt promiſſa. Aut praeter verbum petis, aut non propter verbum petis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be ſure to pray, not only <hi>for love</hi> but <hi>in love.</hi> It is true, that
<hi>Love</hi> is a ſtately Garment to be worn by the Lords children in their Manſion houſe of Glory, but you muſt not put off this Garment till that day, as the world doth Holineſs; Oh ſay they, <hi>holineſs is for Heaven.</hi> Love, and not <hi>Parts;</hi> Love, and not
<hi>Praying;</hi> Love, and not the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170036:180"/> 
                     <hi>participation</hi> (viſibly) of the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Non debet eſſe ſimul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas inter eos qui ſunt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul.</note> is the <hi>badge</hi> of a Diſciple of Chriſt: <hi>By this ſhall all men know ye are my Diſciples, if yee love one another,</hi> Joh. 13.35. Said he, that was as much for
<hi>Faith,</hi> and more, than any of his followers. Chriſtians, Love is <hi>aſleep,</hi> (I hope not in a dead ſleep) for ſhame <hi>awaken</hi> it; Gardiners ſpeak of an Herb <hi>Love lies a bleeding,</hi> and if ever that Herb grew in <hi>Sions</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it is now; Oh
<hi>revive it! Hoſius</hi> was ſo in love with <hi>Charity,</hi> that he thought there was no other <hi>Word of God</hi> than this of <hi>Love.</hi> But oh! that <hi>Love</hi> were by many (at leaſt in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages) accounted to be a <hi>Word</hi> of God. I know there is a kind of
<hi>unity</hi> amongſt <hi>High-way-men,</hi> or elſe their Trade of Robbery would fall. And that love is often pretended againſt <hi>Faith,</hi> and oftner againſt <hi>Holineſs.</hi> The <hi>Souldiers</hi> that were for the <hi>crucifying</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were not
<hi>(q.d.)</hi> for the <hi>crucifying</hi> of his <hi>coat;</hi> they <hi>tore his Body, and yet kept his Coat whole;</hi> but not out of love to Chriſt, but out of love to themſelves, every one of them would fain have had
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170036:180"/> it all. The <hi>Souldiers</hi> had not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but they had his
<hi>Coat,</hi> and ſhall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have <hi>Chriſt</hi> and not his <hi>Coat?</hi> the Body and the Garment muſt go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Never expect your Sacrifice of Prayer ſhould be accepted, til it be ſalted with Love. <hi>Love</hi> knows no difference between party and party, but owns all as <hi>fellow-members</hi> that are partakers of the influence of the <hi>Head.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, That <hi>the Father will not agree to anſwer the prayers of his children that diſagree. God will anſwer the prayers of one childe for another, but not of one child againſt another. If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee,</hi> (where by brother, in the loweſt kind, you muſt not (as ſome do) underſtand, men of the ſame Opinion, but men of the ſame Faith in, and ſame Communion with God), Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It is not ſaid, if thou haſt ought againſt thy Brother, (Mark that) <hi>leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> This <hi>Precept</hi> is <hi>Religious,</hi> and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170036:181"/> certainly the <hi>Practiſe</hi> is not <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To expect that God ſhould anſwer our divided prayers, is to put a jeer on Omnipotency, and to charge the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty with inconſiſtency; it puts an abſurdity on God, in making him to pleaſe man, nay, an impoſſibility, to pleaſe all men.</hi> The diviſions of our prayers may poſſibly cauſe ſome Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to ſuſpect that God is divided,<note place="margin">Deus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit facere, quod nequit fieri.</note> to whom we pray, and in time, occaſion the world to beleeve there is no God at all, for God is but one, and not divided. The Lord, at this time muſt fruſtrate <hi>(q.d. in ſpecie)</hi> many prayers of ſome Chriſtians, as he will be true to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his own Glory. To ſpeak with reverence, God cannot grant all our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and be God. All the godly of all parties pretend the Kingdom of Chriſt; and theſe Opinions, as rigidly maintained, are apparently inconſiſtent together. What a temptation is it then to attempt unlawful means, <hi>q.d.</hi> to force the Lord out of his way? and all, that man might not be proved falſe to his own intereſt, and be cryed up and down for a lyar. <hi>God</hi> (forſooth) <hi>ſhall not be
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170036:181"/> God unleſs he will pleaſe man. (Multi benè cogitant ſed malè precantur. Et ſi volunt eſſe felices, Deum orent, ne quid illis ex his quae optantur eveniat,</hi> Sen. L. Benef. c. 37.) Oh! that the Lord would reconcile theſe diviſions that are betwixt his own people. However, in the interim, let every particular <hi>Jacob wreſtle</hi> with God, and ly quietly aſleep at the bottom of the Ladder. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude here with the advice of Divine Mr. <hi>S.R.</hi> on the <hi>woman of Canaan,</hi> in 4 Rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Go not before, but follow God and <hi>Providence.</hi> Preſcription of ſuch and ſuch means to God, and no other, is to limit <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> and to ſtint the holy one of
<hi>Iſrael. It is arrant Idolatry to limit God to means, as well as to bow down to an Idol.</hi> A <hi>Rams horn</hi> is as near of blood to cauſe the walls of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico</hi> to fall, in Gods hand, as Engins of war; It is eaſier to ſee <hi>what</hi> is inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us, than to ſee
<hi>who</hi> inflicteth it; and we look no higher than the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as if the world created it ſelf; ſo is this, when we dream the creature moveth it ſelf, and is not moved by God. Quietly ſubmit to the <hi>Lords waies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving</hi>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:170036:182"/> can eaſe us, <hi>diſputing cannot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The book of <hi>Providence</hi> is full both Page and Margin. God hath been adding to it ſundry new <hi>Editions,</hi> and like children we are in love with the golden Covering, the Ribbons, fillet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the pictures in the Frontiſpeece, but underſtand little of the
<hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Providence. Who is wiſe and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Degener a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus eſt qui emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vult Deum quam ſe, carpens Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina &amp; Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, alia illa eſſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit magis quam ſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium. <hi>Sen.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>even he ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord,</hi> Pſa. 107.43. God is worthy to be Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicled; there is a contexture of Decrees, Actions, Events, in <hi>Providence,</hi> from the
<hi>creation</hi> to the <hi>conflagration</hi> of the world, and not a thread ſhall ever be broken; though this web be woven of threads of divers colours, <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> comfortable and ſad paſſages of <hi>Providence,</hi> yet all make a fair <hi>order</hi> to God in the way, and ſhall be beautiful to us in the end. As many Herbs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſorts of Flowers, make up one pleaſant and well-ſmelling Meadow, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Roſes, Lillies, and the like, one ſweet-ſmelling <hi>Garden:</hi> ſo there is a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and order in all Gods diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let your ſpirits be kept in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170036:182"/> 
                     <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> in an indifferency in all caſts of
<hi>Providence,</hi> and ſo you are above the croſs. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26. <hi>David</hi> puts his ſoul on Gods two <hi>Ifs, if</hi> he ſave it is good, <hi>if</hi> he deſtroy it is good. Make ſure this general, <hi>Chriſt is mine, at this Anchor, in this Harbor my veſſel ſhall ride. What ever wind blow in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Chriſt dyed for me, if I live its Chriſt, if I dye its Chriſt; if I ride with Princes on Horſes, its good, if I go on foot with Servants, it is good;</hi> If Chriſt hide his face and frown, it is Chriſt, it is good; if he overlade the ſoul with rays and beams of glory, it is alſo Chriſt. Faiths <hi>ſpeculations</hi> to the worſt and hardeſt in point of reſolution is ſweet. Suppoſe the Devil and Hell form the
<hi>Principles,</hi> Faith can make a <hi>concluſion</hi> of God and Heaven. <hi>Job</hi> puts on a concluſion of faith from bad premiſes; <hi>What if God ſhould kill me? yet ile truſt in him, Job</hi> 13.15. What if God throw me into hell, it were well reſolved, I would out of the pit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils cry <hi>Halelujah,</hi> praiſe the Lord in his juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Give not over praying,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170036:183"/> though God ſeem to give over anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>God hears often when he doth not anſwer, and oft his not anſwering, is an anſwer; pray, go on.</hi> The Father will cauſe the child to ſay over again what he once heard him ſay, becauſe he delights to hear him ſpeak. I pray for victory to Gods people in this battel, they loſe the day, yet I am heard and anſwered, becauſe I prayed for that victory, not under the notion of <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> but as linked with <hi>Mercy</hi> to the Church, and honor to Chriſt; now God ſhews mercy and gains Glory in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them, which is the <hi>formal object</hi> of my prayers. <hi>Some Letters require no anſwer, but are meer expreſſions of the deſire of the friend; the generall prayers of the Saints, That God would gather in his Elect, that Chriſt would come and marry the Bride, and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Nuptials, do refer to a real anſwer, when the King himſelf ſhall make his ſecond appearance.</hi> In the expectation of, and patience for which appearance, let the Saints beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, for the <hi>Marriage of the Lamb is a coming, and his wife hath made
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170036:183"/> her ſelf ready, and to her is granted that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white; for the fine linnen is the righteouſneſs</hi> (righteouſneſſes <hi>gr.) of the Saints. And bleſſed are they which are called to the marriage Supper of the Lamb. And behold, he commeth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his reward is with him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the Spirit and the Bride (or the Spirit in the Bride, or the Bride in the Spirit) ſay, Come, and let him that is a thirſt, come; and whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely. Even ſo, come Lord Jeſus,</hi> Rev. 22.12, 17, 20.</p>
